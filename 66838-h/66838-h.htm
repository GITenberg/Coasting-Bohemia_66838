</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> papers which compose this volume make
no claim to any sort of ordered plan in their
composition. They reflect in some measure the
varied activities of a life that has been passed in
close association with more than one of the arts,
and therein lies their sole title to so much of
coherence as they may be found to possess.</p>

<p>Lord Beaconsfield once defined critics as men
who had failed in art. The reproach, however,
is not always deserved, for youth is often confident
in its judgment of others at a time when
it is still too timorous to make any adventure of
its own. For myself I may confess that I had
adopted the calling of a critic long before I had
found the courage to make even the most modest
incursion into the field of authorship. My first
essays in journalism, made at a time when I was
still a student at the bar, were chiefly concerned
with the art of painting, and I look back now
with feelings almost of dismay at the spirit of
reckless assurance in which I then assumed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
measure and appraise the achievement of contemporary
masters. A little later in my career
I was brought into still closer contact with the
art of the theatre, and in both these worlds, as
well as in that of literature itself, I was fortunate
in the formation of many valued and enduring
friendships which have enabled me, in such of
the following chapters as bear a distinctively
biographical character, to record my personal
impressions of some of the notable figures in the
literature and art of the later Victorian era.</p>

<p>The reader who accompanies me in my
voyage along the shores of the Bohemia of that
time will quickly realise that it is not quite the
Bohemia of to-day. Indeed since Shakespeare
first boldly conceded to the kingdom a seaboard,
each succeeding age, and almost every generation,
has claimed the liberty to refashion this enchanted
country in accordance with its own ideals. The
coast-line has been recharted by every voyager
who has newly cruised upon its encompassing
seas, and in recent days its boundaries have been
enlarged by the occasional incursions of Society
which has lately condescended to include the
concerns of art within the sphere of its patronage.
But although no longer retaining its old outlines
upon the map, there is enough of continuity in
the character of the inhabitants and in the subjects
of their preoccupation to render a brief survey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
of earlier conditions of something more than
merely archaeological interest. If much has been
gained, something also has been lost, and the
traveller who survives to set down the experiences
of that earlier time may perhaps be pardoned if
he cannot always accept the changes which have
transformed the face of the country, or modified
the mental attitude of its citizens, as improvements
upon the prospect that first dawned upon
his vision forty years ago.</p>

<p>I read the other day a confident pronouncement
made by one of the apostles of the more
modern spirit which gave me the measure of the
revolution that has been effected in all that
concerns our judgment upon matters of art.
&#8220;Art,&#8221; declared this authority, &#8220;cannot stop:
the moment it rests and repeats itself, or imitates
the past, it dies.&#8221; There is here no faltering or
uncertainty in the assertion of those principles of
faith and criticism which are embodied in the
newer gospel, and it took me a little time to
steady myself in the face of a declaration which
seemed to overturn the settled convictions of a
lifetime. But after much pondering my courage
returned. I perceived that apart from the underlying
truism that life implies movement, and
that art as its image must share its vitality, there
is nothing here that is not highly disputable or
wholly false. Art indeed never stops but it does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
not always go forward: the movement perceptible
at every stage of its history has been as often
retrograde as progressive, and although it can
never repeat itself, there have been again and
again long seasons of rest when after a period of
great productivity the land which has yielded so
rich a harvest lies fallow.</p>

<p>But the final clause of the proposition, that
imitation of the past heralds approaching dissolution,
is demonstrably untrue of every great
epoch of artistic activity. A fearless spirit of
imitation, born of the worship yielded to the
achievements of an earlier time, may, on the
contrary, be claimed as the hall-mark of genius,
and is indeed most frankly confessed in the work
of men of unchallenged supremacy. Raphael
exhibited neither shame nor fear in the frank
reliance of his youth upon the example of
Perugino: the painting of Titian, with an equal
candour, confesses the extent of his debt to
Giovanni Bellini, and Tintoret, who certainly
could not be cited as a man deficient in the
spirit of independence, made it his boast that
he combined the design of Michelangelo with
the colouring of Titian: while of Michelangelo
himself we have it on record that in one of his
earlier efforts as a sculptor a deliberate imitation
of the antique carried him near to the confines
of forgery. And when we pass from individuals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
to the epoch which produced them, was not the
main impulse which governed the movement of
the Renaissance inspired by a renewed sense of
the beauty that was left resident in the surviving
examples of the Art of the antique world? And
all later time yields a similar experience. That
newly born spirit in modern painting associated
with what is known as the pre-Raphaelite movement
rested upon the untiring effort of its professors
to recapture the forgotten or neglected qualities
of the painting of an earlier time, not indeed of
the time which was its immediate forerunner,
but of that still younger day when by simple
means and with technical resources not yet
assured, the earlier painters of Italy sought to
interpret the beauty they found in nature. The
spirit of imitation, conscious and unabashed, was
of the very life blood of the movement, and it
was in their devotion to that period in Italian
painting which preceded the crowning glory
of the Renaissance that the artists whose work
constitutes the most important contribution to
the painting of modern Europe were led to a
stricter veracity in the rendering of the facts in
nature which they sought to interpret.</p>

<p>But the men who laboured in that day were
not greatly affected by the declared ambitions of
the present generation. Originality had not yet
been accepted as the cardinal virtue in any of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
the fields of imaginative production, and the
illusion of progress, which may be said to rank
as the special vice of the moment, found no
place in the teaching of the time. Thinking
over this widely desired and much vaunted
quality of Originality in art, I was minded to
turn to old Samuel Johnson to discover what
particular meaning was then attached to a term
that is now in such constant use. But my
curiosity was baffled, for I discovered to my disappointment
that this much treasured word finds
no place at all in the pages of his <i>Dictionary</i>.
The world is therefore free to conjecture in
what way, if he were living in this hour, that
sane and virile intelligence might have sought
to describe it. As applied to matters of art,
whether literary or pictorial, he would perhaps
have been tempted to define it as &#8220;a word in
vulgar use employed to indicate a vulgar ambition.&#8221;
But without burdening the great lexicographer
with views which the exigencies of the time did
not provoke him to express, this at least may be
confidently affirmed, that the pursuit of whatever
virtue the word implies can have no place
in the conscious equipment of any great artist.
Certainly it was unknown or unregarded in every
great epoch of the past. It is impossible to
think of even the least of the mighty race of
Florentine painters, from Giotto to Michelangelo,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
sparing one foolish moment from the eager intentness
of their labour to ponder whether the
judgment of aftertime should hail their work as
original. That work, in common with all else
that is produced in obedience to the impulse
which is constantly shaping the beauties of the
outer world till they are tuned into harmony with
the spirit resident in the breast of the artist, had no
need of any spur to production beyond that which
is provided by a reverent love and an unceasing
devotion, and it survives to prove, if proof were
needed, that this boasted attribute of Originality,
though it may fitly find a place in the epitaph
upon an artist&#8217;s tomb, never since the world began
formed any part in the impulse that governed
the work of his hand.</p>

<p>The undue importance now assigned to this
coveted quality of Originality is partly the
outcome of the illusion to which I have already
referred,&mdash;that art is in its nature progressive and
is in fact constantly and steadily progressing. It
must be obvious, however, to any one who has
followed the fortunes of the imaginative spirit
in the past, that history affords no warrant for
any such pretension. In whatever field of artistic
industry we choose to enter, in the world of
letters no less than the world of art, strictly
so called, the testimony of the ages bears witness
to the fact that the sense of restless and unceas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>ing
movement is not always accompanied by any
real advancement. Fate has scattered over the
centuries with impartial indifference to the onward
march of time those signal examples of
individual genius which mark for us the summit
of human invention. No one supposes that
Dryden was a greater dramatist than Shakespeare
because he came later: no one would be
so foolish as to suggest that a comparison between
Lycidas and Adonais can be decided by reference
to the historical position of their authors.</p>

<p>And yet it is not difficult to understand how
in our more modern day this illusion of progress
has fastened itself upon the judgment and consideration
of the things of art. The rapid strides
made by science during the last fifty or sixty
years, yielding at every step some new discovery
to arrest the admiration of a wondering world,
has not unnaturally bred an inappropriate spirit
of rivalry in the minds of men whose mission it
was to deal with the widely divergent problems
of the imagination. Indeed it is easy to discern
in the literature of the Victorian era that some
of its professors were apt to be haunted by the
fear that their different appeal might be partly
overborne or wholly silenced unless they too could
prove to their generation that what they had to
offer for its acceptance registered something of a
like superiority to the product of earlier times.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>The sense of inexhaustible variety, characteristic
of all art that truly images the spirit of man,
has by a false analogy been confused with the
onward march of science where every addition to
the accumulated harvest garnered in the past uplifts
each succeeding generation upon the shoulders
of its forerunner. Art cannot compete on such
terms, and any comparison so conducted must
relegate its claims to an inferior place; yet
though so much may be freely confessed, it does
not therefore follow that its unchanging appeal
is to be counted as an unequal factor in shaping
the destinies of humanity. The work of the man
of science, however pre-eminent the place assigned
to him in his generation, must of necessity yield
place to the larger discoveries made by even
the humblest of his followers; while the work
of the artist, the outcome of individual vision
engaged upon the unchanging passions of man
and the unfading beauty of the world he inhabits,
stands secure against any assault from the future;
in its nature distinct from all that has preceded
it as from all that may follow in the time to come.
It knows neither rivalry nor competition, for in
the temple wherein the artist worships, each
worshipper has his separate and appointed place.
In the matchless words of Shelley,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Life, like a dome of many coloured glass,</div>
<div class="verse">Stains the white radiance of eternity,</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>and although the light beyond to which the artist
lifts his eyes is of unchanging purity, the myriad
hues through which it is transmitted yields to
each separate vision the impress of an individuality
which no after achievement can challenge
or destroy.</p>

<p>But there are recurring seasons in the history
of every art when the worker becomes unduly
conscious of the medium in which he labours,
and correspondingly forgetful of the truth he
seeks to interpret. It was this that Wordsworth
had in his mind when he urged upon the poet
the necessity of keeping his eye upon the object,
and it is not difficult to perceive how easily
in the present hour the reiterated demand for
Originality, enforced by the vulgar illusion that
art to be a living force must be a progressive
force, invites the invasion of the charlatan. It
would perhaps not be too much to say that the
little corner of time we now inhabit constitutes
a veritable paradise for the antics of every form
of conscious imposture.</p>

<p>But this fact, even if it be conceded, need
not greatly disturb us. The patient labour of
men more worthily inspired still survives. The
more aggressive spirits in every department of
art, who in their haste to secure the verdict of
the future are eager to cast overboard the hoarded
treasure of the past, may find when time&#8217;s award<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
comes to be recorded that they have won nothing
but the gaping wonder of the fleeting moment.
The judgment of posterity refuses to be hustled
however loud or shrill the voices that call upon
it, and we may take comfort in the thought
that the whispered message, perhaps only half
audible in its generation, has often been the first
to win the ear of the future.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SOME MEMORIES OF MILLAIS</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are men in every walk of life who would
seem deliberately to shun the outward trappings
of their calling. During his later years, when
I knew Robert Browning well, it always appeared
to me that he was at particular pains not to make
any social appeal which could be held to rest on
his claims as a poet. The homage that fell to
him on that score he accepted as his due, but
always, as I thought, on the implied understanding
that in the daily traffic of social life the
subject should not be rashly intruded. In the
many and varied circles in which he moved he
made no demand of any formal tribute to the
distinguished place he held in the world of
letters; and it was sometimes matter for wonder
to those who met him constantly to note with
what apparently eager and sincere interest he
entered into the discussion of any trivial topic
in which it was not to be supposed that he could
have been very deeply concerned. Like Lord
Byron, whose gifts as a poet he held in no great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
esteem, he was rather anxious&mdash;at any rate, in
the earlier stages of acquaintanceship&mdash;that his
position as a poet should be regarded as a thing
apart; and he was apt, I think, to be embarrassed
by any persistent endeavour to penetrate the outward
shard of the man of the world, wherein he
preferred to render himself easily accessible to a
wide circle of friends, few of whom would have
deemed themselves competent to enter into any
sustained discussion of literary topics.</p>

<p>Among the painters of his time Millais would,
I think, have owned to a like inclination.
Neither in his personality nor in his bearing
was he at any pains to announce himself to the
world as an artist; and if not in his earlier days,
at any rate at the time I first began to know him,
he seemed to seek by preference the comradeship
of men whose distinction had been won in
another field. In self-esteem he was certainly
at no time lacking; he could accept in full
measure praise of his own work from whatever
quarter it came; and in that respect he differed
from Browning, whose nature seemed to stand
in less need of flattery, or even of expressed
appreciation. On occasion, indeed, and with
only moderate encouragement, Millais could be
beguiled into a confession of confident faith in
his own powers that might sometimes seem to
border on arrogance, but at the worst it was no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
more than the arrogance of an overgrown boy,
put forward with such genuine conviction as to
rob it of all offence. At these times he would
give you the impression that, having won the
top place in his class, he intended to hold it.
He could not readily endure the thought, or
even the suspicion, that there was anybody
qualified to supplant him, and he was apt to be
impatient, and even restive, when other claims
were advanced, as though he felt the world was
wasting time till it reached the consideration of
what he was genuinely convinced was a higher
manifestation of artistic power. And yet thee
judgments upon himself, even when they were
delivered in the most buoyant and conquering
spirit, never left the savour of pretentious vanity.
There was an air of impartiality that I think
was genuine, even when his self-esteem was most
emphatically expressed, as though he were recording
the award of a higher tribunal, in whose
verdict his own personality was in no way
involved.</p>

<p>And then there was so much that was immediately
lovable in the man himself as distinguished
from the artist! I have heard it said
by an older friend who knew him in the season
of his youth that when, as a mere boy, he quitted
the schools of the Academy to begin the practice
of his art, he had the face and form of an Adonis,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
and his handsome and commanding presence
when I first met him, toward the close of the
seventies, a man then nearing fifty years of age,
made it easy to believe that this record of the
charm of his youthful appearance was in no way
exaggerated. And yet the frank outlook of the
face, with its clear blue eyes, and firm, yet finely-modelled
mouth, though it spoke clearly of
power and resource, and betrayed in every
changing mood of expression the unconquerable
optimism of a nature that retained its full vitality
to the last, did not, I think, then, or at any time,
yield any decisive indication of the direction in
which his gifts were employed. Afterwards I
learned to find in his features the true index of
the finer qualities of his genius, but at our first
encounter it seemed to me rather that I stood in
the presence of a robust personality that had been
bred and nurtured in the free air of the country.</p>

<p>It was always, indeed, easier to think of him
as one of a happy and careless company during
those annual fishing and shooting holidays in
which he so greatly delighted, than to picture
him a prisoner in a London studio, arduously
applying himself to the problems of his art.
And, in point of fact, he always brought something
of that sense of breezy, outdoor life into
the spacious studio at Palace Gate. Perhaps, if
he could have followed his own inclination, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
would have passed a greater part of his life on
the banks of the northern river that he loved so
well. Quite in the later years of his life, when
he was rebuking his old friend and comrade,
Holman Hunt, upon a too obstinate indifference
to the taste of his time, he said to him: &#8220;Why,
if I were to go on like that, I should never be
able to go away in the autumn to fish and shoot.
You take my advice, old boy, and just take the
world as it is, and don&#8217;t make it your business to
rub up people the wrong way.&#8221; Millais&#8217;s ready
acquiescence in the demands of his generation
was to some extent an element of weakness in
his artistic character, leading him occasionally,
as he more than once confessed to me himself,
into errors of taste that he was afterwards shrewd
enough to detect and candid enough to deplore;
but however far he may on occasion have been
led astray towards a certain triviality in choice
of subject, this tendency never impugned or
injured his integrity as a painter in the chosen
task he had set himself to accomplish. The
presence of nature, either in human face or form,
or in the facts of the external world, proved a tonic
that sufficed to restore his artistic conscience, and
I do not think he was ever satisfied by the
exercise of any acquired facility, for it was both
the strength and the weakness of his art that his
ultimate success in any particular adventure largely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
depended upon the inspiration supplied by his
model.</p>

<p>One day we were talking of technique,
and I remember Millais, who was at the time
in some trouble with a portrait that he could not
get to his satisfaction, roundly declared that, for
an artist worth the name, there was no such
thing as technique. &#8220;Look at me now,&#8221; he
said; &#8220;I can&#8217;t get this face right, and it has
been the same with me all through my life&mdash;with
every fresh subject I have to learn my art
all over again.&#8221; Such a confession came well
from a man who, from the earliest time of his
precocious and marvellous boyhood, had in the
native gifts of a painter clearly outpaced and
outdistanced the most accomplished of his contemporaries,
and yet it was made in no spirit of
mock modesty, but out of a clear conviction that
an artist&#8217;s conflict with nature is ceaseless and
unending, no matter what degree of mastery the
world may choose to accord him.</p>

<p>We first met at the Old Arts Club, in Hanover
Square. He was not a very constant visitor
there, for his inclination, as I have already
hinted, did not often carry him into a mixed
company of his fellow-workers; but he occasionally
looked in of an evening after dinner, and
sometimes I used to walk away with him towards
his home in Kensington. In his talk at the club<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
he was apt to exhibit a genuine impatience of
any desponding view of the present condition or
the future prospects of English art, and the unbroken
success of his own career&mdash;for at that
time he had long outlived, and perhaps almost
forgotten, the struggles of his youth&mdash;made it,
I think, really difficult for him to comprehend
that the arena in which he had won his undisputed
place was not the best of all possible worlds.
But this overbearing optimism of view was not
always entirely sympathetic in its appeal; he
was apt to brush aside with imperfect consideration
the comparative failure of his less fortunate
contemporaries, and it was not until long afterwards
that I grew to realise that this apparent
indifference to the fortunes of others sprang less
from any natural lack of sympathy than from
an intellectual incapacity to understand the possibility
of real merit failing to secure recognition.
Something of an egotism that was at times almost
aggressive must indeed be allowed to him&mdash;an
egotism which I believe left him with a genuine
belief that nearly all other ideals than those he
followed were misguided, and that lesser achievements
than his own scarcely merited prolonged
consideration.</p>

<p>But when we had left the club and were
alone together in the street the more human and
sympathetic side of his character often came into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
play. Not that he was, even then, apt to lavish
extravagant praise upon his immediate contemporaries,
but he could speak often and lovingly
of the men with whom he had been brought into
association in his earlier days, both in literature
and in art, always reverting, in terms of special
affection, to his friendship for John Leech, of
whom he was wont to say that he was &#8220;the
greatest gentleman of them all.&#8221; Dickens, too,
he genuinely admired, though the great novelist
had failed to recognise the earlier efforts of his
genius; and he had many interesting anecdotes
of Thackeray, with whom he had been brought
into close contact during the time when he was
engaged in the practice of illustration, telling
me how, during periods of illness, he would be
summoned to the distinguished editor&#8217;s bedside
to receive instructions for the drawings he was
commissioned to execute for the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i>.</p>

<p>It was during one of those talks about
Thackeray that he related how he came to make
his first acquaintance with the name of Frederic
Leighton, in an anecdote which he afterwards
told with telling effect, as part of a speech at the
Arts Club, on the occasion of Leighton&#8217;s election
to the post of President of the Academy. He
recounted how Thackeray had warmly praised
the talents of the young painter, whom he had
met in Rome, prophesying for him the final<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
distinction he afterwards achieved; and Millais
confessed how, even then, he had felt a certain
measure of jealousy in the novelist&#8217;s warmth of
appreciation, conscious that he already cherished
the idea that he himself would one day occupy
the presidential chair. And so, indeed, he did,
but the honour fell upon him almost too late,
when he was already in the grip of the malady
that was destined to carry him to the grave.
But his reference to the work of other painters,
however distinguished, was, as I have already
hinted, comparatively rare, and the dominant
impression left from all our talks of that time
was of a man whose own ever-increasing prosperity
had left him partially blind to qualities
in others that had missed an equal measure of
recognition. He could perceive little or no
flaw in a world which had accorded to him his
unchallenged position.</p>

<p>The finer and gentler side of Millais, half
hidden from me then under an overpowering
and impenetrable armour of optimism, I learned
to know better when, as one of the directors of
the Grosvenor Gallery, I assisted in the arrangement
of the collected display of his life&#8217;s work.
That was in the year 1886, and I can vividly
recall with what easy self-complacency he anticipated
the pleasure which he would derive from
this long-looked-for opportunity of seeing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
product of many years of labour displayed in a
single exhibition. Before the arrival of the
paintings themselves, many of which he had not
seen from the time they had left his easel, he
was afflicted by no trace of the nervous apprehension
which I have found not uncommonly
betrayed by other artists in similar circumstances.
But the triumphant buoyancy of this earlier
mood was replaced by many an hour of deep
dejection when the works themselves appeared
in their place; and that dejection again was
sometimes as swiftly replaced by a spirit of
almost unlimited self-esteem as he discovered in
some particular example qualities greater than
his recollection had accorded it.</p>

<p>The essential charm of the man&#8217;s nature shone
out very clearly during that fortnight of preparation,
and the invulnerable armour of self-esteem
in which he was wont to appear before the world
would sometimes fall from him in an instant,
leaving in its place a spirit of humility that
belonged to the deeper part of his nature. It
was sometimes almost touching to note the mood
of obvious dejection in which he would quit the
gallery at the close of the day&#8217;s work, and no
less interesting to observe with what alacrity the
next morning he would recapture the confident
outlook that was a part of the necessity of his
being. He would sometimes be in the gallery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
half an hour or more before the usual time for
the work of hanging to begin, and we would find
him on our arrival with his short cherrywood
pipe in his mouth surveying with evident satisfaction
the pictures already placed upon the walls.
And on those occasions he would often run his
arm through mine and draw me away to compel
my admiration of some forgotten excellence in
this picture or in that, the renewed vision of
which had sufficed completely to restore his self-complacency.</p>

<p>But these moments of exultation were not
long-enduring, and it was an integral part of the
fascinating <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> of his character that he could
with equal emphasis in the presence of some less
desirable performance accuse himself roundly of
having slipped into vulgarity and bad taste.
There was one thing, however, he never could
endure, and that was the suggestion that his
latest achievement was not also his best, and
this conviction so entirely possessed him that he
set himself in very vigorous fashion to the task
of correcting what he conceived to be the faults
of some of his earlier works. I confess I looked
upon this adventure with something approaching
dismay, for it was evident enough, though he
was in no way conscious of it, that the Millais
of 1886 was not the Millais of thirty years before,
who had laboured under the influence of earlier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
and different ideals. Happily the emphatic
protests of one or two of the owners from whom
the pictures had been borrowed cut short this
crusade of fancied improvement upon which he
had embarked, and in one instance, although
sorely against his will, he was forced to remove
the fresh painting from the surface of the canvas.</p>

<p>Some of the essays of that earlier time of
youthful impulse and more poetic design had
grown unfamiliar to him. Many of them he
had not seen from the date when they first left
his studio, and I recall in particular with what
eager and yet nervous expectation he awaited
the arrival of &#8220;The Huguenot,&#8221; a picture that
had served as the foundation of his fame as a
young man. I think as he saw it unpacked,
with its delicate beauty untarnished by time,
that for the moment his faith in the uninterrupted
progress of his career was partly shaken.
I know at least that his voice trembled with
emotion as he muttered some blunt words of
praise for a picture which, as he said, was &#8220;not
so bad for a youngster,&#8221; and I remember that as
it took its place upon the wall, after gazing at
it intently for some time in silence, he relit his
pipe and took his way thoughtfully down the
stairs into the street.</p>

<p>Millais used to contend that, until the advent
of Watteau, the beauty of women had found no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
fit interpreters in art, and he would cite the
example of Rembrandt as showing how poorly
the feminine features which he portrayed compared
with the lovely faces imaged by Reynolds
and Gainsborough. Perhaps he was hardly
equipped to deliver final judgment on such a
subject, for I do not think he leaned with any
enthusiasm towards those finer examples of
Italian painting wherein the subtleties of feminine
beauty have certainly not suffered by neglect.
But these dogmatic assertions of men of genius,
if they are not irrefutable in themselves, are
often instructive in illuminating the finer tendencies
of their own achievement; and it will
remain as one of Millais&#8217;s indestructible claims
to recognition that both in his earlier and in his
later time he was able to interpret with matchless
power the finer shades of emotional expression
in the faces of beautiful women. When
the chosen model rightly inspired him&mdash;and
without that model his invention was often vapid
and inert&mdash;he could succeed in a degree which
no other artist has matched or surpassed in
registering not only the permanent facts of
beauty in form and feature, but in arresting
with equal felicity the most fleeting moments of
tender or passionate expression.</p>

<p>In the later days of his life it was at the
Garrick Club that I saw most of Millais, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
there, in the card-room, he was to be found
nearly every afternoon, and as we both then
dwelt in Kensington we often wandered homeward
together. The buoyancy of his youth and
early manhood never quite deserted him, even
at that sadder season, when he was already in
conflict with that dread opponent against whom
his all-conquering spirit was powerless, and
I never heard from him, however great the
dejection of spirit he must have suffered, a single
sour word concerning life or nature. His outlook
on the world was never tainted by self-compassion,
never clouded by any bitterness of
personal experience, and one came to recognise
then, as his life and strength gradually waned
and failed, that the spirit of optimism which
seemed sometimes unsympathetic in the season
of his opulent vigour and virility was indeed a
beauty deeply resident in his character, which
even the shadow of coming death was powerless
to cloud or darken.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">AT HOME WITH ALMA-TADEMA</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> death of Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema,
following only too closely upon the loss of his
gracious and gifted wife, finally closed the doors
of one of the most delightful houses that overlooked
the shores of Bohemia. They both
possessed in rare measure the genius of friendship,
and to both belonged the fine and generous
sympathy of nature which is the abiding secret
of true hospitality. And in their case a friendship
once formed was steadfastly held. There are
men and women not a few, who, as they advance
along the path that leads to fame and distinction,
contrive to shed the friends and comrades
of an earlier day in haste to make room for guests
more important or influential. This was never
true of Tadema at any period of his career, and
those who can recall the earlier Tuesday evenings
at Townshend House, which looked across the
waters of the canal to the green shade of the
Regent&#8217;s Park, can bear witness that the simplest
and most modest of his associates of that time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
found as cordial a welcome in the more spacious
premises which he afterwards built for himself
in the Grove End Road.</p>

<p>It was in the year 1877 that I first became
an intimate guest at the pleasant weekly receptions
at Townshend House, and I remember that
what first struck me about them was the delightful
sense of ease and informality that the host
and hostess contrived to infuse into every gathering.
Sometimes the friends assembled might
number only a few; sometimes the rooms would
be thronged with all that was most notable in
the world of literature and art; but the party,
whether large or small, knew no constraint of
dulness, nor were we ever oppressed by that
overpowering sense of social decorum which is
apt to benumb the best-intentioned efforts of
ordinary English hospitality. And, this I think,
was due in great measure to an element in
Tadema&#8217;s character that was almost unique.</p>

<p>Shakespeare has told us of the &#8220;boy eternal,&#8221;
and many men of distinction have owned and
kept that quality to the end of their days. But
Tadema went one better, for he retained throughout
his life some of the simple impulses and
attributes of a veritable child. He had the
wondering delight of a child in each new experience
as it came within the range of his
vision, and there were times when some passing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
ebullition of temper would betray something also
of a child&#8217;s wayward petulance. It was characteristic
of this side of his nature, which for the rest
ranked among the most masculine and virile I
have known, that he preserved to the last a child&#8217;s
abiding delight in all forms of mechanical toys.
This was a weakness well known to his intimate
friends, who, on the annual occasion of his
birthday, would vie with one another in presenting
him with the most admired achievements of
the toy-maker&#8217;s art. I remember, in particular,
a certain ferocious tiger, which moved by clock-work
across the polished floor of the studio.
Tadema was absolutely fascinated by the antics
of this mimic beast, remaining under the spell
of its enchantment during the whole of the
evening; and whenever a pause in the music
permitted it, I could hear the whirr of the
wheels of the clock as the delighted owner of
this new plaything prepared to start it again upon
an excursion round the room.</p>

<p>These birthday parties were occasions fondly
cherished by our host. He loved every detail in
the little ceremonial that might be arranged for
their celebration, and would reckon up with the
earnest intentness of a schoolboy over his first
sum in arithmetic, the candles set around
his birthday cake, that counted the sum of his
years. And then followed the inevitable speech<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
proposing his health&mdash;a task which usually fell
to my lot; whereupon Tadema, who always
thought that whatever was done in his honour
exceeded in excellence any tribute accorded to
another, would stoutly maintain that, as an effort
in oratory, it far surpassed any speech he had
ever heard made. This na&iuml;ve delight of his in
little things, that remained as a constant element of
his character, was linked with a large generosity
of nature in all that concerned the greater issues
of life. And if he exacted from all who came
within the range of his influence the little acts of
homage and respect that he thought were his due,
there was no one who would so freely place himself
at the disposal of those whom he believed he could
serve. He loved to gather round him the young
students of his craft, ever on the alert to note and
welcome new talent as it appeared, and when
his counsel or advice was needed, he would spare
neither time nor pains to afford the aid and
encouragement which his superb technical resources
so well fitted him to bestow. I have heard
artists of position declare that if they had reached
some crux in a picture that proved difficult of
solution, there was no one so helpful as Tadema;
and this, I think, was due mainly to the fact
that his quick sympathy and swift apprehension
enabled him at once to appreciate the point of
view of the comrade who had sought his advice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>The last of those pleasant Tuesday evenings
at Townshend House, which occurred in the
spring of 1885, brought with it a certain feeling
of sadness that found constant expression as the
evening wore on. We had all become deeply
attached to the quaintly-adorned dwelling where
so many joyous evenings had been passed,
and some there were who may have been
conscious of a lurking fear lest the more spacious
premises that were then in course of reconstruction
in the Grove End Road should rob these
festive gatherings of some part of the ease and
intimacy that had hitherto been their most
delightful characteristic. Certain it was that for
his friends during many months to come, the
week would contain no Tuesday worth the name,
and as we parted that night I think there was a
wide-spread feeling that the new order of things
could never rival the old. But such fears, so
often justified by experience, proved in this case
wholly without foundation, and when, in the
autumn of 1887, we were bidden to the richly-decorated
new studio, in the construction of
which Tadema had taken such infinite delight,
it was found that the old spirit of hospitality,
unchanged and unimpaired, was able quickly
to accommodate itself to its more imposing
surroundings.</p>

<p>I had known the house in Grove End Road<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
before it took on the stamp of Tadema&#8217;s quaint
invention and fanciful ingenuity. It had been
inhabited by the French painter Tissot during
a great part of his residence in England, and I
recall a dinner party given by him on an occasion
shortly after the opening of the Grosvenor
Gallery, at which he announced to me his
serious and solemn intention of making a radical
revolution in the purpose and direction of his
art. Up to that time the pictures of this most
adroit of craftsmen had been wholly mundane,
it might even be said demi-mundane, in character;
but he had been profoundly impressed by the
recent display of the works of Burne-Jones, to
which the public for the first time had accorded
a larger welcome; and it immediately struck
the shrewd spirit of Tissot that there were commercial
possibilities in the region of ideal art of
which he was bound as a practical man to take
account and advantage. As he himself na&iuml;vely
expressed it on that evening: &#8220;Vraiment, mon
ami, je vois qu&#8217;il y a quelque chose &agrave; faire&#8221;;
and he forthwith led the way to his studio,
where he had already commenced a group of
allegorical subjects, to the infinite amusement of
his friend Heilbuth, who at that time, I think,
knew him better than he knew himself.</p>

<p>In those days, Tadema and Burne-Jones were
scarcely acquainted. Their real friendship came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
a little later, but when it came it was very
genuine and sincere, resting on a certain quality
of simplicity which they owned in common and
a strong feeling of mutual respect and esteem.
Their ways in art lay far asunder, but each knew
how to value at their true worth the gifts of the
other. From time to time they would both
join me in little Bohemian feasts at Previtali&#8217;s
Restaurant in Coventry Street, where we would
sit till the closing hours in pleasant converse that
was never permitted to be protractedly serious.
Tadema generally prefaced the evening with an
anecdote which he always believed to be entirely
new, and even when its hoary antiquity was not
in doubt, Burne-Jones never failed to supply
a full measure of the laughing appreciation
that was due to novelty. In his more serious
moods, however, Tadema&#8217;s talk was marked by
deep conviction and entire sincerity. He never
acquired complete mastery over our language, but
he could always find the word or phrase that
reached the heart of what he wanted to say. In
his art, no less than in his views on art and life,
he was desperately in earnest, and there was
something even in the quality of his voice that
aptly mirrored the mind and character of the
man. Indeed, to be quite correct, it was not
one voice, but two, for sometimes even within
the compass of a single sentence the tone would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
swiftly change from the guttural notes that
betrayed his northern origin to those softer
cadences that seemed to echo from some southern
belfry.</p>

<p>I have often thought that this contrast of intonation
in his speech reflected in a measure the
dual influences that dominated his painting. By
his heart&#8217;s desire, he belonged to a land that was
not the land of his birth and to an epoch far
removed from the present. The call of the
spirit led him backward and southward&mdash;to the
streets of ancient Rome and the sunlit shores of
the Mediterranean; but, for all his journeyings,
his genius as a painter remained securely domiciled
under northern skies. The saving grace
of his art, whatever the material upon which it
was employed, differed little, indeed, from that
which gives its surviving charm to the art of
his countryman De Hoogh. Both will live in
virtue of their unfailing love of light. It is
that, or, at least, that above all else, that will
make their achievements delightful and indestructible.
&#8220;No man has ever lived,&#8221; Burne-Jones
once said to me, &#8220;who has interpreted
with Tadema&#8217;s power the incidence of sunlight
on metal and marble.&#8221; And although Tadema
left the simple interiors of De Hoogh far behind
him in his learned reconstruction of the buildings
of antiquity, it was with a temper and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
purpose closely allied to that of De Hoogh that
he loved to revel in quaintly-chosen effects of
light and shade, admitting sometimes only the
tiniest corner of the full sunshine from the outer
world, just to illumine as with the dazzling
brilliance of a jewel the imprisoned half-tones
that flood the foregrounds of his pictures.</p>

<p>To those who can look below the surface,
this central quality of his genius, which he
inherited as part of his birthright, will be found
reappearing in unbroken continuity throughout
the splendid series of his work that lately adorned
the walls of Burlington House. Their fertile
invention, and the strong and vivid sense of
drama that often moves that invention; the
patient industry and wide learning which have
served to recreate the classic environment wherein
his chosen characters live and have their being&mdash;these
things would count for little in the final
impression left by his art, if he had not carried
with him in all his wanderings into the past and
towards the south, that vitalising principle of
light, which, in hands fitly inspired, is able to
bestow even upon inanimate things a pulsing
and sentient existence. &#8220;There is nothing either
beautiful or ugly,&#8221; as Constable once said, &#8220;but
light and shade makes it so.&#8221; Alma-Tadema
had learnt this secret long ago, when he was
little more than a boy, and before he had quitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
his native land, and he retained it to the very
end of his career.</p>

<p>This is not the occasion to appraise at its full
value the worth of Tadema&#8217;s artistic achievement,
nor would even those who are his warmest
admirers seek to deny that in many of its aspects
it is open to criticism. But at a time when the
antics of the charlatan are invading almost every
realm of art, his patient and unswerving loyalty
to a chosen ideal stands forth as a shining example
to all who may come after him. That his powers
in the region of design confessed some inherent
limitations he himself was entirely conscious.
I remember one day when we were discussing
the claims of several of his contemporaries, he
said to me suddenly, &#8220;You know, my dear fellow,
there are some painters who are colour-blind,
and some painters who are form-blind. Now,
Leighton, for instance, is colour-blind, and I&mdash;well,
I, you know, am form-blind.&#8221; The
criticism was perhaps unduly severe in both
directions, but it announced a pregnant truth
and proved that he was not unaware of those
particular qualities in which his weakness was
apt to betray itself.</p>

<p>This was said during the time when Hall&eacute;
and I were arranging the collected exhibition of
his works at the Grosvenor Gallery, and when he
had had a full opportunity of passing in review<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
the gathered achievement of many years&#8217; labour.
Those days we passed together superintending
the process of hanging were wholly delightful,
and served to bring out many interesting
characteristics of Tadema&#8217;s nature. When the
exhibition was first projected Tadema had laid
down a rule for our guidance, which he emphatically
declared must not be departed from.
&#8220;The arrangement,&#8221; he said, &#8220;must be strictly
chronological&#8221;; for the whole interest of such
a collection, as he held, lay in the image it
presented of an artist&#8217;s gradual development.
We offered no objection at the time, though we
knew well by previous experience that adherence
to so rigid a principle was inconsistent with
decorative effect; and we were, therefore, not
unduly surprised when Tadema appeared one
morning with the revolutionary announcement
that the chronological arrangement must go by
the board; insisting, with the air of a man who
had hitherto unwillingly yielded to our pedantic
tradition, that the only fit way to hang an
exhibition was to make the pictures look well
upon the walls.</p>

<p>The last time I met Alma-Tadema was at a
little supper party given by Sir Herbert Tree
on the occasion of the first performance of
<i>Macbeth</i>. It was impossible for those who had
known him in the days of his full vigour not to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
be conscious even then that his health was failing.
From the time of his wife&#8217;s death, he had never,
indeed, shown the same elasticity of spirit,
though with valiant courage he had set himself
to take up the broken thread of his life, retaining
even to the last that loving and humorous
welcome of his friends that had been his unfailing
characteristic in happier days. But although
admittedly no longer robust, his unflagging
interest in the theatre and his friendship for
Tree had brought him from home on that
evening, and availed to hold him a prisoner for
the little impromptu feast that followed the play.</p>

<p>My first experience of Tadema&#8217;s work for the
theatre was on the occasion of the production of
Mr. Ogilvie&#8217;s play of <i>Hypatia</i>, when I had
persuaded him, at Tree&#8217;s invitation, to undertake
the designs for the scenery and costumes. This
is a kind of work to which many gifted painters
cannot readily adapt themselves. But Tadema&#8217;s
constructive talent, his rare ingenuity in dealing
with architectural problems, and, above all, his
unrivalled gifts in contriving diversified effects of
light and shade, amply fitted him for such a
task; and the difficulty which some painters experience
of yoking their intended design with the
interpretative resources of the scenic artists, proved
no difficulty to him. He loved their art with
all its infinite devices for the production of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
illusion, and he knew how to treat them in a
spirit of true and loyal comradeship. At the first
I had been a little nervous on this score, but, one
day, when I asked him how he and the principal
scene-painter were progressing, he relieved me
of all anxiety upon the matter by the emphatic
announcement that he and his associate were in
such complete agreement that, as he quaintly
phrased it from a peasant formula recalled from
the land of his birth, &#8220;we are like two hands on
one stomach.&#8221; As the production neared completion,
I remember one evening, we were
waiting for Tadema, who had been detained by
a council meeting at the Royal Academy. The
most important scene was ready set, and, as it
seemed to us, with really admirable effect; but
when Tadema arrived everything was wrong.
He scattered objection and criticism in every
direction, sometimes, as I thought, with so little
reason that I cast about to discover what could
be the source of his discontent. Suddenly I
remembered that the hour was late, and that, as
he had come straight from Burlington House to
keep the appointment, the probability was that
he had not dined. I put the question to him,
and his answer was immediate, &#8220;Of course I
have not dined.&#8221; &#8220;Then,&#8221; I said, &#8220;let us dine,
and leave the men to put these matters right.&#8221;
The cure acted like magic, for when we returned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
to the theatre an hour later, Tadema
readily found a way by which every defect might
be set right.</p>

<p>I was associated with him at a later time with
several other productions which he made for the
stage, notably the <i>Coriolanus</i>, in the later days
of the Lyceum, and, in a lesser degree as far as
my work was concerned, in the <i>Julius Caesar</i>
presented by Sir Herbert Tree. I think such
work was always a pleasure to him, because it
brought into play qualities that are not directly
involved in the work of a painter. His talent
had always a strongly practical side, and it was
that which made the construction and perfecting
of his own house so keen a pleasure to him.
His labours there would, I believe, have remained
incomplete even if he had lived for another
twenty years. He was always discovering new
possibilities that opened the door for fresh improvements,
and his knowledge of the details of
every craft employed in his service was so
exacting and complete that the skilled artificers
who laboured for him knew well that they were
under the trained eye of a master as well as of
an employer.</p>

<p>When I called at his house on the day that
brought the news of his death, the quaintly
covered way that leads to the front door was
girt on either side by a wealth of varied blooms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
that had been made ready by his gardener to
greet his expected return from abroad; and then,
a few days later, as I stood beside his coffin that
had been reverently set down in the great studio,
I found it buried beneath an avalanche of flowers,
which his countless friends had sent as a last
mark of love and affection. And it was, indeed,
a fitting tribute to the dead artist; for Tadema,
while he lived, had an absolute passion for
flowers. As a painter he would linger with
untiring devotion over each separate petal of
every separate bloom, and yet with such a sustained
sense of mastery in the rendering of their
beauty that when the result was complete the
infinite mass of perfected detail was found to be
firmly bound together by the controlling force
of a single effect of light and shade. To a young
man who stood beside his easel on a day when
he was making a careful study of azaleas that
formed an integral part of the design upon which
he was engaged, Tadema summed up in a single
sentence the spirit in which he constantly
laboured: &#8220;The people of to-day, they will tell
you,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that all this minute detail&mdash;that
is not art!&#8221; And then, turning again to his
picture, he added in his quaint English: &#8220;But
it has given me so much pleasure to paint him
that I cannot help thinking it will give, at least,
some one pleasure to look at him, too.&#8221; This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
was the spirit of the older men before the
pestilent pursuit of originality came to infect the
modest worship of Nature, and it will remain
as the dominant quality of all art, whether of
to-day or to-morrow, that is destined to outlive
the passing fashion of an hour.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">WITH ROSSETTI IN CHEYNE WALK</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Passing</span> along the Chelsea Embankment a while
ago I was reminded by the sight of Rossetti&#8217;s
old house of the number of studios where I
was once a constant visitor, which time had
long since left untenanted. Millais, Leighton,
Whistler, Fred Walker, Cecil Lawson, and Burne-Jones
were among the names that crowded upon
my recollection; and thinking of these men and
of their work, I could not but be reminded of
the changed spirit in which art has come to be
regarded in these later days of restless experiment
and ceaseless research after novelty of form and
expression.</p>

<p>And yet those earlier times of which I am
speaking were also marked by conflict and
controversy; for even in the seventies, when I
first became actively engaged in the study of
painting, the stirring spirit of English Art still
throbbed in response to the message that had
been delivered by the pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood
more than twenty years before. It may be a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
fancy, but I hardly think the workers or students
of a later generation can quite understand the concentrated
eagerness and expectation which awaited
each new achievement of that small group of
men upon whom the hope of the time had been
set. We did not, perhaps, then quite realise
that the revolution, so far as they were concerned,
was already complete, and that what was to come
was not destined to signalise any new or important
development of what had already been
accomplished.</p>

<p>Millais, Holman Hunt, and Rossetti, the
three men who stand as the authentic founders
of the pre-Raphaelite movement, had all, in the
only sense in which their names still stand in
linked association, produced the work by which
they will be best remembered. During the
twenty years that had passed since the movement
took birth, the output of these three men, at
first bitterly disputed and sometimes keenly
resented, was in a sense the best that any or all
of them were destined to give to the world&mdash;in
a sense, I say, because their after-career, whatever
new triumphs it proclaimed, exhibited a partial
desertion of the aims which had held them in
close comradeship during the brief season of
their youth. It is probable that no three stronger
or more distinct personalities ever laboured in the
pursuit of a common purpose; and it was therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
inevitable that as the years passed they should
each assert in separate ways the widely divergent
tendencies which at the time I am speaking of
were held in subjection to a common ideal.
But when it is remembered what their combined
efforts had already produced, the result must
stand, I think, as a record unmatched in the
domain of painting by any contemporary achievement
in the art of Europe. Millais had painted
and exhibited, among many other and less
notable works, &#8220;The Feast of Lorenzo,&#8221; &#8220;The
Carpenter&#8217;s Shop,&#8221; the &#8220;Ophelia,&#8221; the &#8220;Huguenot,&#8221;
and the &#8220;Blind Girl&#8221;; Holman Hunt,
whose methods as a painter were not calculated
to win such ready acceptance, had none the less
firmly established his fame by his picture of the
&#8220;Light of the World,&#8221; at first roundly denounced
by most of the organs of public opinion, but in
the end, as much perhaps by reason of its intense
religious sentiment as by its qualities of pure art,
achieving through the advocacy of Mr. Ruskin
a settled place in public esteem; and Rossetti,
although during these years little or nothing had
been shown to the world, was already accepted
by those of the inner circle who were admitted
to his confidence as the chief exponent of the
spiritual tendencies of the new movement.</p>

<p>In 1873, when I first made the acquaintance
of Rossetti, I knew more of his verse than of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
painting. The first volume of his poems had
been before the world for nearly three years, and
it was hardly wonderful that the picturesque
beauty of his writing, with its occasional direct
reference to paintings and designs of his own,
should have stirred within me an eager curiosity
to make acquaintance with the pictures themselves.
It happened about this time that I
gained access to the small but choice collection
of Mr. Rae of Birkenhead, which contained
several of the most beautiful of Rossetti&#8217;s works;
and filled with admiration of what I had seen, I
had written, over the signature of Ignotus, an
article in one of the daily papers containing an
incomplete but enthusiastic appreciation of
Rossetti&#8217;s powers. Searching where I could, I
afterwards made myself acquainted with some of
his designs in black and white; but still eager
for a wider knowledge of a man whose poetic
invention had laid so strong a hold upon me, I
ventured to address myself directly to the recluse
of Cheyne Walk, praying that if he could see
his way to grant my request I might be permitted
to visit his studio. From that time our acquaintance
began. His letter in reply to mine,
wherein I had mentioned a project then in my
mind of enlarging my brief essay so as to make
it more worthy of its subject, already revealed to
me some part of that reticent side of his nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
which our later friendship helped me the better
to understand.</p>

<p>&#8220;My youth,&#8221; he wrote to me, &#8220;was spent
chiefly in planning and designing, and whether I
shall still have time to do anything I cannot tell.&#8221;
And then, in conclusion, he added: &#8220;As to
what you ask me about views connected with my
work, I never had any theories on the subject,
or derived, as far as a painter may say so, suggestions
of style or tendency from any source save
my own natural impulse.&#8221;</p>

<p>This letter, dated, as I have said, in 1873,
shows how little an artist may be aware what
part of his life&#8217;s work is destined to constitute
his enduring title to fame. Still eagerly looking
forward, he had already produced the work by
which he will be best remembered, for although
in years a young man&mdash;he was not more than
forty-five at the time of our first acquaintance&mdash;his
progress as a painter was not afterwards
destined to record any notable development.
&#8220;Beata Beatrix,&#8221; &#8220;The Loving Cup,&#8221; &#8220;The
Beloved,&#8221; the &#8220;Monna Vanna,&#8221; the &#8220;Blue Bower,&#8221;
and the &#8220;Lady Lilith&#8221; already stood to his
credit, besides the series of water-colours, including
&#8220;Paolo and Francesca,&#8221; and the beautiful
pen-and-ink design of &#8220;Cassandra.&#8221;</p>

<p>The room into which I was shown on the
occasion of my first visit to Cheyne Walk came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
to seem to me as aptly characteristic of the man.
It offered few or none of the ordinary features
of a studio, and in its array of books around the
walls spoke rather of the man of letters than of
the painter; and the careless disposition of the
simple furniture, though it bore some tokens of
the newer fashion introduced by William Morris
and Rossetti himself, made no very serious appeal
on the score of deliberate decoration. It was
obviously the painter&#8217;s living room as well as
his workshop, and as I came to know it afterwards,
remains associated in my mind with many
long evenings of vivid and fascinating talk, in
which Rossetti roamed at will over the fields
of literature and art. But the thing that at once
took me by surprise on that first visit was the
masculine and energetic personality of the man
himself.</p>

<p>From what I knew of his persistent seclusion,
and in part, also, from what I had gleaned from
the subtle and delicate qualities expressed both
in his painting and in his poetry, I was prepared
to find in their author a man of comparatively
frail physique and of subdued and retiring
address. Nothing could be less like the reality
that confronted me on that May afternoon, as
he stood beside his easel at work upon the
picture before him. It was not till much later,
and then only by indications half-consciously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
conveyed, that I recaptured the picture of
Rossetti as I had first found it reflected in his
verse and in his painting. Little by little, as
I got to know him better, I realised that my
fancied image of him did indeed mirror qualities
that lay deeply resident in his character; but at
the first encounter it was the dominating strength
and vigour of his intellect and the overpowering
influence of a personality rich in varied
sympathies, that struck itself in vivid outline
upon the imagination of the observer.</p>

<p>As our intercourse and our friendship advanced,
it was easy enough to comprehend the source of
that potent spell which he wielded over all who
came within the sphere of his influence. Without
any reservation, I may say of him that he
was beyond comparison the most inspiring talker
with whom I have ever been brought into
contact: certainly the most inspiring to a youth,
for his conversation, although it sought no set
phrase of eloquence, flowed in a stream that was
irresistible; and yet so quick was his appreciation
and so keen his sympathy that the youngest man
of the company could always draw from him
encouragement to speak without fear upon any
theme that sincerely engaged him. I have heard
him sometimes &#8220;gore and toss&#8221; without mercy
any one who ventured to enter the debate with
an empty ambition of display. Of insincerity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
view, of any mere flimsy preciousness or prettiness
of phrase, he was always impatiently intolerant;
but he was equally quick to recognise and to
welcome a thought truly held and modestly
stated. At such times his ready power of evoking
a full and fearless statement of what even
the most insignificant of his visitors had to say
was scarcely less inspiring than the rich and
rounded tones of his own voice, as it glowed in
enthusiastic appreciation of some worshipped hero
in the field of art or letters. And though his
work owns to a concentration and intensity of
purpose that would seem sometimes to imply a
corresponding narrowness of vision, it was in his
work only that such a limited outlook could be
said to be characteristic of the man.</p>

<p>That he dwelt by preference on the imaginative
side of life, and chiefly chose for eulogy
achievements in which the imagination was
the dominating factor, is unquestionably true;
but his taste within the wide limits of the
region he had explored was catholic and comprehensive
to a degree that I have not known
equalled by any of his contemporaries. And
lest this should seem an exaggerated estimate of
the man as I knew him then, I may here quote
the testimony of others who stood nearer to him
than I did. Burne-Jones, his pupil and disciple,
wrote long afterwards: &#8220;Towards other men&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
ideas he was decidedly the most generous man
I ever knew. No one so threw himself into the
ideas of the other men; but it was part of his
enormous imagination. The praises he had first
lavished upon me, had I not had any inborn
grains of modesty, would have been enough to
turn my head altogether.&#8221; And at another time
he wrote: &#8220;What I chiefly gained from him
was not to be afraid of myself, and to do the
thing I liked most; but in those first years I
only wanted to think as he did, and all he did
and said fitted me through and through. He
never harangued or persuaded; he had a gift of
saying things authoritatively, such as I have never
heard in any man.&#8221;</p>

<p>But there is, indeed, no surer testimony to
the magic of his personality than is betrayed in
the restive spirit with which his two comrades
of those earlier days endeavoured afterwards to
assert their independence of his influence. Both
Sir John Millais and Mr. Holman Hunt, in
their later life, went out of their way to try to
prove to the world that the pre-Raphaelite movement
would have been in no way changed in its
direction if Rossetti had not been one of the
original group. I often talked with Millais on
this subject, and it was easy to perceive that he
harboured something almost of resentment at
the bare suggestion that the direction of his art<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
was in any sense due to the example or teaching
of Rossetti; and of the Millais of later years,
who had partly discarded the poetic impulses of
his youth, it may be readily conceded that he
owed nothing to the man whose art, whether in
its splendour or in its decay, was governed always
by the spirit of imaginative design.</p>

<p>And equally of Holman Hunt who, in his
two long volumes, has so laboriously and so
needlessly laboured to vindicate his own independence,
it may be admitted without reservation
that his kinship with the spirit in which Rossetti
worked was transient and almost accidental.
But it remains, nevertheless, unquestionably true
that during that brief season of close comradeship,
the supremacy of Rossetti&#8217;s genius is very clearly
reflected in the work of both. The aftergrowth
of talents as great as&mdash;and in some respects greater
than&mdash;his, led each of these men into ways of
Art that owned, it may be freely confessed, no
obligation to Rossetti; and of the rich gifts of
Millais as a painter, extraordinary in their precocity
and developed in increasing power almost
to the end of his career, no one could exhibit
keener or truer appreciation than Rossetti himself.
I recall on one of those nights in Cheyne Walk
with what power and fulness of expression he
paid willing homage to Millais&#8217; genius. &#8220;Since
painting began,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I do not believe there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
has ever been a man more greatly endowed.&#8221;
And then he went on to speak with genuine
humility of his own many shortcomings in
technical accomplishment, wherein he admitted
that Millais stood as the unchallenged master
of his time.</p>

<p>Rossetti was the kindest, but most careless,
of hosts, and the many little dinners at which
I was permitted to be a guest always had about
them something of the air of improvisation.
Of the actual details of the feast, from a culinary
point of view, he seemed to take little heed,
and there was something quaint and humorous
in the way in which, at the head of his table,
he would attack the fowl or joint that happened
to be set before him, lunging at it with the
carving knife and fork almost as if it were an
armoured foe who had challenged him to mortal
combat. I remember on one of those occasions
an incident occurred that showed in striking
fashion the quick warmth of his heart at the
sudden call of friendship. We were in the
midst of cheeriest converse. Fred Leyland, one
of his staunchest and earliest patrons, was of
the company, when the news came by special
messenger that young Oliver Madox Brown
was stricken with serious illness. It chanced
that we had been talking of the young man&#8217;s
youthful essays, both in art and in literature,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
and Rossetti had spoken in almost exaggerated
praise of the promise they displayed, when the
letter was handed to him. He remained silent
for a moment, though it was easy to see by the
working of his face that he was deeply distressed.
&#8220;Brown is my oldest friend,&#8221; he said. &#8220;His
boy is ill, and I must go to him; but that need
not break the evening for you.&#8221; And then,
without any added word of farewell, he left us
where we sat, and in a moment we heard the
street door close, and we knew that he had gone.
For a time we lingered over the table, but
Cheyne Walk was no longer itself without the
presence of its host. We passed into the studio,
where Rossetti was wont to coil himself up on
the sofa in preparation for long hours of talk,
and we felt as by common consent that the
evening was at an end.</p>

<p>The circumstance was slight enough in itself,
but I remember feeling afresh how magical
and inspiring was the spell he exercised over
us all, and I little realised then that this
friendship with Rossetti, which had proved so
powerful a factor in moulding the intellectual
tendencies of my own life, was not destined much
longer to endure. For a time, indeed, the old
welcome always awaited me, but after a time I
thought I detected a certain reserve and restraint
in our intercourse which I was unable to explain.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
A little later those longed-for invitations to dine
at Cheyne Walk ceased altogether, and once or
twice when I called the studio door, always open
to me heretofore, was closed, on the excuse that
the painter was too busily engaged. It was not,
indeed, until after his death, that I learnt from
his truest and most trusted friend the cause of
our alienation.</p>

<p>Rossetti, although he never exposed his own
pictures to public criticism, was, like every artist
who has ever lived, eager for the praise of those
whose praise he valued; and his nature, already
grown morbid under the stress of influences that
were undermining his health, was not without
an element of jealousy that seemed strangely
inconsistent with the tribute he could on many
an occasion offer to the work of others. He saw
but little of Burne-Jones in those days, but he
knew that I saw him often. He knew, also,
from my published criticism, that I was strongly
attracted to his genius, and although I have heard
Rossetti himself speak of his pupil and follower
in terms of laudation that could not be surpassed,
the thought, as I learnt later, had already begun
to poison his mind that my allegiance to himself
had suffered diminution; and he frankly confessed
to the friend from whom little in his life was
hidden that my presence in Cheyne Walk became
to him, for this reason, a source of irritation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
which, in the condition of his health, he was
unable to endure.</p>

<p>Such flaws in a nature so splendidly endowed
count for nothing in remembrance of the picture
of him that remains to me as I first knew him
in the plenitude of his intellectual powers. For
a time it seemed as if the great movement at the
head of which his name must enduringly remain
was likely to suffer eclipse. The taste of later
years had taken an entirely different direction,
and the ideals which the small band he led had
striven so manfully to recapture from a renewed
study of nature and a finer understanding of the
artistic achievements of the past appeared to have
sunk into oblivion. It was therefore a delight
to find in Rome in the spring of two years ago how
enthusiastic was the welcome accorded to a man
who, while he ranks so high among English
painters, owned in his veins the blood of Italy and
from whose painters, at that bewitching season
when the spirit of the Renaissance was in its
youth, he had drawn the inspiration which was
destined to kindle his own genius.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">EDWARD BURNE-JONES</h2>
</div>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">I think</span> Morris&#8217;s friendship began everything
for me; everything that I afterwards cared
for; we were freshmen together at Exeter.
When I left Oxford I got to know Rossetti,
whose friendship I sought and obtained. He is,
you know, the most generous of men to the
young. I couldn&#8217;t bear with a young man&#8217;s
dreadful sensitiveness and conceit as he bore with
mine. He taught me practically all I ever learnt;
afterwards I made a method for myself to suit my
nature. He gave me courage to commit myself
to imagination without shame&mdash;a thing both bad
and good for me. It was Watts, much later, who
compelled me to try and draw better.</p>

<p>&#8220;I quarrel now with Morris about Art. He
journeys to Iceland, and I to Italy&mdash;which is a
symbol&mdash;and I quarrel, too, with Rossetti. If I
could travel backwards I think my heart&#8217;s desire
would take me to Florence in the time of
Botticelli.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Burne-Jones wrote of himself more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
forty years ago. It chanced I had just then
written a series of papers on living English
painters; and, with the thought of their re-publication,
had asked him for some particulars
of his earlier career. The scheme, I remember,
was never carried into effect; but his answer
to my inquiry, from which I have drawn this
interesting fragment of autobiography, served
as the beginning of a long friendship that was
interrupted only by death.</p>

<p>In those boyish essays of mine there was, as I
now see, not a little of that quality of youthful
conceit that could never, I think, have entered
very largely into his composition; and if I recall
them now with any sort of gratification, it is
mainly because they included an enthusiastic
appreciation of so much as was then known to
me of the work of Rossetti and Burne-Jones. Of
Rossetti&#8217;s art I have already spoken, and perhaps
the time has not yet arrived to record a final
verdict upon the worth of his achievement as
a painter. I have also sought to indicate how
irresistible in my own case was the influence
of his strongly marked personality, an influence
which enabled me the more readily to understand
how deep may have been the debt that
is here so generously acknowledged. In this
matter the witness of his contemporaries is irrefutable.
Even though posterity should not accord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
to him the unstinted praise bestowed upon his
art by those who then accepted him as a master,
no later judgment can dispute or disturb the
authority he exercised over those who came
within the sphere of his personal fascination.</p>

<p>Little wonder then that to the dream-fed soul
of the younger painter, whose art as yet lacked
the means to fix in form and colour the thronging
visions that must have already crowded his
brain, the friendship of such a man must have
seemed a priceless possession; and although,
with the patient and gradual assertion of Burne-Jones&#8217;s
individuality, their ways in the world of
Art divided, yet even in that later day each knew
well how to measure the worth of the other.
Of what was highest and noblest in the art of
Rossetti, no praise ever outran the praise offered
by Burne-Jones to the man he had sought and
owned as his master; and I can recall an evening
in Cheyne Walk more than forty years ago,
when there fell from the lips of Rossetti the
most generous tribute I have ever heard to the
genius of the painter who was still his disciple.
&#8220;If, as I hold,&#8221; he said, in those round and
ringing tones that seemed at once to invite and
to defy contradiction, &#8220;the noblest picture is a
painted poem, then I say that in the whole
history of Art there has never been a painter
more greatly gifted than Burne-Jones with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
highest qualities of poetical invention.&#8221; Here
we have praise indeed; but there is at least one
painter, he whose long life still kept the stainless
record of unswerving loyalty to a noble ideal,
to whom also Burne-Jones has here owned his
indebtedness, who would, I believe, have accepted
and endorsed even such a judgment as this.
And if an artist&#8217;s fame lives most sweetly, most
securely, in the regard of his fellows, who could
ask aught higher of the living or the dead of
our times, than that the award of Rossetti should
be confirmed and enforced by the painter of
&#8220;Love and Death&#8221;?</p>

<p>&#8220;A picture is a painted poem.&#8221; Upon that
Rossetti never tired of insisting. &#8220;Those who
deny it,&#8221; he used to add in his vehement way,
&#8220;are simply men who have no poetry in their
composition.&#8221; We know there are many who
deny it,&mdash;many, indeed, who think it savours of
the rankest heresy; for herein, as they would
warn us, lurks the insidious poison of &#8220;the
literary idea.&#8221; Nor can such warning ever be
without its uses. The literary idea, it must be
owned, has often played sad havoc in the domain
of art. Much, both in painting and sculpture
that the world has rightly forgotten or would
fain forget, found the source of its failure in
misguided loyalty to a literary ideal; much
even that survives still claims a spurious dignity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
from its fortuitous attachment to an imaginative
conception that had never been rightly subdued
to the service of Art.</p>

<p>But though the warning be timely, the
definition which it confronts is not on that
account to be lightly dismissed. It is true, as
Rossetti stoutly maintained, and must ever
remain true, of all men who have poetry in their
nature. It was true, from the beginning of his
career to its close, of the art of Burne-Jones.
From &#8220;The Merciful Knight&#8221; to the unfinished
&#8220;Avalon,&#8221; wherein, as it would seem, he had
designed to give us all that was most winning
in the brightly-coloured dreams of youth,
combined with all that was richest in the
gathered resources of maturity, his every picture
was a painted poem. Nay, more, every drawing
from his hand, every fragment of design, each
patient study of leaf or flower or drapery, has in
it something of that imaginative impulse which
controls and informs the completed work. I
have lately been turning over the leaves of some
of those countless books of studies he has left
behind him, studies which prove with what
untiring and absorbing industry he approached
every task he had set himself to accomplish.
And yet, amongst them all, of mere studies there
are none. Again and again he went back to
nature, but ever under the compelling impulse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
of an idea, always taking with him an integral
part of what he came to capture. That unprejudiced
inspection of the facts of nature
which, in the preliminary stages of their work,
may content those who are moved by a keener
and colder spirit of scientific research, he had
not the will, he had not the power to make.
For every force carries with it its own limitation;
nor would it ever have been his boast that nature
owned no more than she was fain to yield to
him. If, then, with unwearied application he
was constantly re-seeking the support of nature,
it was with a purpose so frankly confessed, that
even in the presence of the model the sense of
mere portraiture is already seen to be passing
under the dominion of the idea. At their first
encounter the artist&#8217;s invention asserts its
authority over his subject; and not all the
allurements of individual face or form which to
men of a different temperament are often all-sufficing,
could find or leave him unmindful of
the single purpose that filled his mind and guided
all the work of his hand.</p>

<p>It is this which gives to the drawings of
Burne-Jones their extraordinary charm and
fascination. He who possesses one of these
pencil studies has something more than a leaf
torn from an artist&#8217;s sketch-book. He has in
the slightest of them a fragment that images the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
man: that is compact of all the qualities of his
art; and that reveals his ideal as surely as it
interprets the facts upon which he was immediately
engaged. And yet we see in them
how strenuously, how resolutely, he set himself
to wring from nature the vindication of his own
design. There is no realist of them all who
looked more persistently at life, who spared
himself so little where patient labour might
serve to perfect what he had in his mind to do;
and if the treasure he bore away still left a rich
store for others, it is because the house of beauty
holds many mansions, and no man can hope to
inhabit them all.</p>

<p>&#8220;A picture is a painted poem.&#8221; Like all
definitions that pass the limits of barren negation
it contains only half a truth. Like most definitions
forged by men of genius it is chiefly valuable
as a confession of faith. There is a long line of
artists to whom, save in a forced and figurative
sense, it has no kind of relevancy. And they
boast a mighty company. Flanders and Spain
serve under their banner. Rubens and Velasquez,
Vandyck and Franz Hals, aye, and at no unworthy
distance, our own Reynolds and Gainsborough
are to be counted among the leaders of
their host. And long before the first of these
men had arisen, the tradition they acknowledged
had been firmly established. It was Venice that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
gave it birth. Venice, where not even the commanding
influence of Mantegna could hold back
the flowing tide of naturalism that rose under the
spell of Titian&#8217;s genius. Out of his art, which
contained them both, came those twin currents of
portraiture and landscape that were destined to
supply all that was vital in the after development
of painting in Europe. All that was vital; for
though Religion and Allegory, History and
Symbol, still played their formal part in many
a grandiose and rhetorical design, these things
were no longer of the essence of the achievement.
To the painters who employed them, nature
itself was already all-absorbing. The true poetry
of their work, whatever other claims it may seem
to advance, resides in the mastery of the craftsman;
it cannot be detached from the markings of the
brush that give it life and being. To wring
from nature its countless harmonies of tone and
colour, to seize and interpret the endless subtleties
of individual form and character&mdash;these are the
ideals that have inspired and have satisfied many
of the greatest painters the world has produced.
Who then shall say that Art has need of any other,
any wider ambition?</p>

<p>And yet, as I have said, the house of beauty
has so many mansions that no single ideal can
furnish them all. Nature is prodigal to those
who worship her; there is fire for every altar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
truly raised in her service. And so it happened
that while Venice was perfecting a tradition
destined for many a generation to sway the
schools of Northern Europe, there had risen and
fallen at Florence a race of artists, such as the
world had not seen before and may haply not see
again, who had asked of Nature a different gift,
and had won another reward. That imperishable
series of &#8220;painted poems&#8221; which had been first
lisped in the limpid accents of Giotto, had found
their final utterance in the perfected dialect of
Michael Angelo. In the years that intervened
many hands had tilled the field; many a harvest
had been gathered in: but so rich had been the
yield that the land perforce lay fallow at the
last; and when Michael Angelo died, Florence
had nothing to bequeath that the temper of the
time was fit to inherit.</p>

<p>From that day almost to our own the ideal of
the Florentine painters has slept the sleep of Arthur
in Avalon. Those who from time to time have
sought to recapture their secret have gone in their
quest, not to the source, but to the sea. They
have tried to begin where Lionardo, Raphael,
and Michael Angelo left off; to repeat in poorer
phrase what had been said once and for all in
language that needed no enlargement, that would
suffer no translation. They made the mistake of
thinking that the forms and modes of art are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
separable things, independent of its essence; that
the coinage moulded by the might of individual
genius could be imported and adopted as common
currency; and so even the most gifted of them
carried away only the last faltering message of a
style already waning and outworn. To look
only to the painters of our own land, we know
well what disaster waited upon men like Barry,
Fuseli, and Haydon in their hapless endeavours
to recover the graces of the grand style; and
even Reynolds, though he never wearied in
praise of Michael Angelo, was drawn by a surer
instinct as to his own powers into a field of Art
that owed nothing to the great Florentine. A
truer perception of what was needed, and of what
was possible, in order to revive a feeling for the
almost forgotten art of design, came in a later
time, and was due, as I have always thought,
mainly to the initiative of Rossetti. Not because
he stood alone in the demand for a more searching
veracity of interpretation; that was also the
urgent cry of men whose native gifts were widely
different from his, men like the young Millais,
who owned and paid only a passing allegiance to
the purely poetic impulse which youth grants to
all, and age saves only for a few, and then sped
onwards to claim the rich inheritance that awaited
him in quite another world of Art. But if this
new worship of nature was indeed at the time a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
passion common to them all, yet amongst them
all Rossetti stands pre-eminent, if not absolutely
alone, in his endeavour to rescue from the traditions
of the past, and to refashion according to
present needs, a language that might aptly render
the visions of legend and romance.</p>

<p>And this in a larger and wider sense became
afterwards the mission of Burne-Jones. This
was his life-work&mdash;to find fitting utterance in
line and colour for dreams of beauty that in
England at least had till now been shaped only
in verse. And to accomplish his task he was
driven, as he has said, to make a method to suit
his own nature. The surviving traditions of style
could avail him little, for he already possessed by
right of birth a secret long lost to them. With
him there never was any question of grafting the
perfected flower of one art upon the barren stem
of another. There, and there only, lurks the
peril of the literary idea. But it could have had
no terrors for him, who from the outset of his
career submitted himself, as by instinct, to the
essential conditions of the medium in which he
worked, moving easily in those shackles which
make of every art either an empire or a prison.
Of the visions that came to him he took only
what was his by right, leaving untouched and
unspoiled all that the workers in another realm
might justly claim as theirs. Every thought,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
every symbol, as it passed the threshold of his
imagination, struck itself into form; he saw
life and beauty in no other way. There was no
laboured process of translation, for his spirit lived
in the language of design; but labour there must
have been, and, as we know, there was, in perfecting
an instrument that had been so long
disused. To be sure of his way he had to seek
again the path where it had been first marked
out by men of like ambitions to his own; and it
was by innate kinship of ideas, not by any forced
affectation of archaic form, that at the outset of
his career he found himself following in the
footsteps of the painters of an earlier day.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I could travel backwards I think my
heart&#8217;s desire would take me to Florence in the
time of Botticelli.&#8221; It was by no accident that
he chose this one name among many, for of all
the painters of his school Botticelli&#8217;s art asserts
the closest, the most affectionate attachment
to the ideas which gave it birth. Others could
be cited whose work bears the stamp of a deeper
religious conviction; others again whose technical
mastery was more complete, who could boast a
readier command of the mere graces of decoration.
But he was the poet of them all. For
him, more than for all the rest of his fellows, the
beauty of the chosen legend exercised the most
constant, the most supreme authority. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
the source of his invention and the dominating
influence which guided every subtle detail of his
design. It made his art, as it formed and controlled
all the processes of his art, leaving the
indelible record of individual and personal feeling
upon the delicate beauty of every face that he
pressed into his service. It is not wonderful
then that the poet-painter of our day should
have recognised with almost passionate sympathy
the genius of the earlier master, or that he should
sometimes have travelled backwards in spirit to
the city wherein he dwelt; and if that longer
journey upon which he has now set forth should
lead him not to Florence, who is there who shall
declare that he may not have met with Botticelli
by the way?</p>

<p>It is no part of my present purpose to offer
any laboured vindication of the art of Burne-Jones.
That is not needed now. The generous
appreciation of a wider circle has long ago overtaken
the praise of those who first gave him
welcome; and for others who have yet to learn
the secret of his influence, the fruit of his life&#8217;s
labour is there to speak for itself. But in the
presence of work that is clearly marked off from
so much else produced in our time, it may be
well to ask ourselves what are the qualities we
have a right to demand, what, on the other hand,
are the limitations we may fitly concede to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
painter whose special ambition is so frankly
avowed. For there is no individual and there is
no school whose claims embrace all the secrets of
nature, whose practice exhausts all the resources of
art. To combine the design of Michael Angelo
with the colouring of Titian was a task that lay
not merely beyond the powers of a Tintoret. It
is an achievement impossible in itself; and even
could we suppose it possible, it would be
destructive and disastrous. Titian had design,
but its qualities were of right and need subordinated
to the dominant control of his colour;
Michael Angelo used colour, but it served only
as the fitting complement of his design; and
although the result achieved by both has the
ring of purest metal, there is no power on earth
that can suffice to fuse the two. These two
names, we may say, stand as the representatives
of opposite ideals, which have been fixed and
separated by laws that are elemental and enduring;
and if between these ideals&mdash;leaning on
the one hand towards symbolism, on the other
towards illusion&mdash;the pendulum of art is for
ever swaying, this at least we know, that it can
never halt midway.</p>

<p>And between these ideals Burne-Jones made
no hesitating choice. For him, from the outset
of his career, design was all in all, and the
forms and colours of the real world were in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
essence only so many symbols that he employed
for the expression of an idea. His chosen types
of face and form are fashioned and subdued to
bear the message of his own individuality. No
art was ever more personal in its aim, or, to
borrow an image of literature, more lyrical in its
direction. The scheme in which he chose to
work did not admit of wide variety of characterisation,
but for what is lacking here we have, by
way of compensation, a certainty, an intensity of
vision that supplies its own saving grace of
vitality. There is nothing of cold abstraction or
formal classicism. Though his art affects no
mere transcript of nature, and can boast not all
the allurements of nature, yet nature follows
close at its heels; and if the beauty he presents
has been formed to inhabit a world of its own,
remote from our actual world, we are conscious
none the less that he had fortified himself at
every step by reference to so much of life as he
had the power or the will to use. And again we
may see that while his mind was bent upon the
poetic beauty of Romantic legend, he never
suffered himself to depend upon that merely
scenic quality that seeks for mystery in vague
suggestion or uncertain definition. His design,
whatever the theme upon which it is engaged,
has the simplicity, the directness of conviction.
He needs no rhetoric to enforce his ideas. All<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
that he sees is clearly and sharply seen, with
something of a child&#8217;s wondering vision, with
something also of the unsuspecting faith and
fearless familiarity of a child.</p>

<p>And, as with his design, so also with his
colour. He worked in both at a measured
distance from reality, never passing beyond the
limits he had assigned to himself, and using only
so much of illusion as seemed needful for the
illustration of his idea. The accidents of light
and shade, with their infinite varieties of tint and
tone, which yield a special charm to work
differently inspired, were not of his seeking. He
would indeed, on occasion, so narrow his palette
as to give to the result little more than the
effect of sculptured relief; he could equally,
when so minded, range and order upon his
canvas an assemblage of the most brilliant hues
that nature offers. But in either case he
employed what he had chosen always with a
specific purpose&mdash;for the enrichment of his
design, not for any mere triumph of imitation.
Few will deny to the painter of the <i>Chant
d&#8217;Amour</i> and <i>Laus Veneris</i> the native gift of a
colourist, but we may recognise in both these
examples, and, indeed, in all he has left us, that
the painter disposes his colours as a jeweller uses
his gems. They are locked and guarded in the
golden tracery that surrounds and combines them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
And they may not overrun their setting, for to
him, as to all whose genius is governed by the
spirit of design, the setting is even more precious
than the stone.</p>

<p>These qualities of Burne-Jones&#8217;s art are not
peculiar to him. They find their warrant, as we
have seen, in all the work of that earlier school
to which he loved to own his obligation. But
they were strange to the time in which he first
appeared; and to their presence, I think, must
be ascribed no small part of the hostility he then
encountered. Something, no doubt, was due to
the immaturity of resource which marked his
earlier efforts. And he knew that. At a time
when his imagination had already ripened, he
was but poorly equipped in a purely technical
sense; and although there is no education so
rapid as that which genius bestows upon itself, it
was long before his hand could keep pace with
the pressing demands of the ideas that called for
interpretation. But apart from mere technical
failure, there was in his own individuality, and
still more in the means which he recognised as
the only means that could rightly serve him, not
a little that was sure of protest from a generation
to whom both were unfamiliar. This also he
well knew; and I think it was the clear perception
of it which gave him patience and
courage to press forward to the goal.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>And there were times when he had need of
both. The critics who saw in his earlier efforts
only the signs of affectation greeted him with
ridicule. We are reported a grave nation, but
laughter is a safe refuge for dulness that does not
understand; and as there were few of the comic
spirits then engaged upon art criticism who had
the faintest apprehension of the ideal which inspired
his art, they found in it only a theme for
the exercise of a somewhat rough and boisterous
humour. But they never moved him from his
purpose; never, I think, even provoked in him
any strong feeling of resentment. His nature was
too gentle for that, his strength of conviction too
deep and too secure. No one ever possessed a
larger quality of personal sympathy; no one, it
might seem, was on that account so much exposed
to the influence of others. And in a sense
this was so. In the lighter traffic of life his
spirit flew to the mood of the hour. His appreciation
was so quick, his power of identifying
himself with the thoughts and feelings of others
so ready and so real, that he seemed at such
moments to have no care to assert his own
personality. Nor had he; for of all men he was
surely the most indifferent to those petty dues
that greatness sometimes loves to exact. That
was not the sort of homage he had any desire to
win; and as he put forward no such poor claim<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
on his own behalf, his keen sense of humour
made him quick to detect in others the presence
or assumption of mere parochial dignity. Of
that he was always intolerant; indeed, I think
there was scarcely any other human failing for
which he could not find some measure of
sympathy. But although in the free converse of
friends his spirit passed swiftly and easily from
the gravest to the lightest themes, anxious, as it
would seem, rather to leap with the lead of
others than to assert his own individuality, it was
easy to see how firmly, how resolutely, he refused
all concession in matters that concerned the
deeper convictions of his life. To touch him
there was to touch a rock. Behind the affectionate
gentleness of his nature, that was accessible to
every winning influence, lay a faith that nothing
could shake or weaken. It was never obtruded,
but it lay ready for all who cared to make trial
of it. In its service he was prepared to make all
sacrifice of time and strength and labour. His
friends claimed much of him, and he yielded
much; generous both in act and thought, there
was probably no man of such concentrated
purpose who ever placed himself so freely at the
service of those he loved; but there was no
friend of them all who could boast of having won
any particle of the allegiance that the artist owed
to his art. That was a world in which he dwelt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
alone, from which he rigorously excluded all
thoughts save those that were born of his task;
and though every artist has need of encouragement,
and he certainly loved it not less than
others, yet such was the tenacity of his purpose,
such a fund of obstinate persistence lay at the
root of a nature that was in many ways soft and
yielding, that even without it I think he would
have laboured on patiently to the end.</p>

<p>A mind so constituted was therefore little
likely to yield to ridicule. Such attacks as he had
to endure may have wounded, but they did not
weaken his spirit; and with a playful humour
that would have surprised his censors, he would
sometimes affect to join the ranks of his assailants,
and wage a mock warfare upon his own ideals.
I have in my possession a delightful drawing of
his which is supposed to represent a determination
to introduce into his design a type of beauty
that was more acceptable to the temper of his
time. He had been diligently studying, as he
assured me, the style and method of the great
Flemish masters, and he sent me as earnest of his
new resolve a charming design of &#8220;Susanna and the
Elders,&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;after the manner of Rubens.&#8221; On
another occasion he wrote to me that he felt he
had striven too long to stem the tide of popular
taste, that he was determined now to make a
fresh departure, and that with this view he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
projected a series of pictures which were to be
called the &#8220;Homes of England.&#8221; He enclosed
for my sympathetic criticism the design for the
first of the series. It was indeed a masterpiece.
Upon a Victorian sofa, whose every hideous and
bulging curve was outlined with the kind of
intimate knowledge that is born only of love or
of detestation, lay stretched, in stertorous slumber,
the monstrous form of some unchastened hero of
finance. A blazing solitaire stud shone as a
beacon in a trackless field of shirt-front: while
from his puffy hand the sheets of a great daily
journal had fallen fluttering to the floor. There
were others of the series, but none, I think, which
imaged with happier humour that masculine type,
whose sympathies at the time he was so often
charged with neglecting.</p>

<p>For it must not be forgotten that when
ridicule had done its work, Burne-Jones was very
seriously taken to task by &#8220;the apostles of the
robust.&#8221; There are men so constituted that all
delicate beauty seems to move them to resentment;
men who would require of a lily that it
should be nurtured in a gymnasium; and who go
about the world constantly reassuring themselves
of their own virility by denouncing what they
conceive to be the effeminate weakness of others.
To this class the art of Burne-Jones came in the
nature of a personal offence. They raged against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
it, warning their generation not to yield to its
insidious and enervating influence; and the more
it gathered strength the more urgently did they
feel impelled to insist on its inherent weakness.
But, as Shakespeare asked of us long ago:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">How with this rage shall Beauty hold a plea</div>
<div class="verse">Whose action is no stronger than a flower?</div>
</div></div>

<p>They forgot that: forgot that something of a
feminine, not an effeminate spirit enters into the
re-creation of all forms of beauty; that an artist,
by the very nature of his task, cannot always be
in the mood to pose as an athlete. And, even
if they had desired to define the special direction
of Burne-Jones&#8217;s art, or to mark the limits of its
exercise&mdash;limits that no admirer, however ardent,
would seek to deny&mdash;they need not surely have
been so angry.</p>

<p>So at least it seemed to me then. And yet,
rightly viewed, the very vehemence of such
opposition was in its own way a tribute to his
power. Any new artistic growth that passes
without challenge may perhaps be justly suspected
of being produced without individuality,
and certainly such work as his, that bears so
clearly the stamp of a strong individual presence,
could hardly escape a disputed welcome. It
must even now in a measure repel many of those
whom it does not powerfully attract and charm;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
for it cannot be regarded with the sort of indifference
that is the fate of work less certainly
inspired; it must therefore always find both
friends and foes. But so does much else in the
world of art that speaks with even higher
authority than his. There are many to whom
the matchless spell of Lionardo&#8217;s genius remains
always an enigma; many again who yield only a
respectful assent to the verdict which would set
Michael Angelo above all his fellows.</p>

<p>We may be patient, then, if the genius of
Burne-Jones wins not yet the applause of all. It
bears with it a special message, and is secure of
homage from those for whom that message is
written. They are many to-day, who at the
first numbered only a few: they are many, and
I think even the earliest of them would say that
their debt to him was greatest at the last. In
praise and love they followed him without
faltering to the close of a life that knew no
swerving from its ideal; a life of incessant labour
spent in loyal service to the mistress he worshipped;
and even though he had won no wider
reward, this, I believe, would have seemed to
him enough.</p>

<p>Painting is perhaps the only art which offers
in its practice opportunities of social converse.
The writer and musician work alone, or, if
their solitude is invaded, it is only by way of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
interruption. But the practice of the painter&#8217;s
art admits a measure of comradeship, and the
progress of his work is sometimes even advanced
rather than hindered by the presence of a friend.
The element of manual labour that enters into
painting leaves the painter free at many points of
his work to enjoy friendly converse with the
visitor to his studio; and I have known many
an interesting discussion carried on for several
hours without the painter ceasing for a moment
from his work upon the canvas before him.
This might not apply to every stage in the
growth and structure of a picture. There are
times which demand entire concentration both of
brain and hand, and when the painter needs to be
as solitary as the poet. But these tenser moments
yield to longer intervals wherein the manual
element in the painter&#8217;s calling holds for a season
a more dominating place; and it is at such
times that an intimate friend may safely invade
the artist&#8217;s sanctuary.</p>

<p>Some of the most enjoyable hours of my life
have been passed in this intimacy of the studio,
and it is interesting to recall, as it was always
interesting to note, the different ways in which
the individuality of the artist expresses itself in
the processes of his work&mdash;interesting also to
observe how the litter of the studio in its varying
degrees of disorder reflects something of the mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
of the man. There are studios which seem
deliberately fashioned for an effect of beauty&mdash;rooms
so ornate and so adorned, that the
picture in progress upon the easel seems the last
thing calculated to arrest the gaze of the spectator.
And there are others again, so completely barren
of all decoration, and so deliberately stripped of
every incident in the way of bric-&agrave;-brac or
collected treasures, of carven furniture or woven
tissue, that were it not for the half-finished
canvas, it would be impossible to guess the
vocation of its inhabitant. Between these two
extremes there is room for every degree of
careless or conscious environment; and although
it is not always possible to define the exact
measure of association between the workman and
his surroundings, the visitor becomes gradually
aware of a certain element of fitness in the
seemingly accidental accumulation of the varied
objects which find their way into a painter&#8217;s
workshop.</p>

<p>It would certainly, however, be erroneous to
assume that the disorder of the studio is to be
taken as the direct reflex of the habit of an artist&#8217;s
mind. No man, in the conduct of his work,
ever surrendered himself to a stricter discipline of
labour than Burne-Jones, though his studio in
many respects was a model of apparent disorder.
No man certainly in his work ever aimed at a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
more settled and nicely balanced beauty of design
supported by deliberate harmonies of colour; and
yet the bare white-washed walls of his studio
in the North End Road gave no hint of the
coloured glories of the invention that he was
seeking to fix upon his canvas; while the litter
that scattered the floor or was unceremoniously
hustled into the corners of the room seemed
strangely inconsistent with the ordered completeness
of design that marked every picture from
his hand.</p>

<p>There were few more delightful companions
in the studio&mdash;none, according to my experience,
whose talk leapt with such easy alertness from
the gravest to the gayest themes. His almost
child-like spirit invited humour; and yet his
lightest moods of laughter left you never in
doubt of the sense of deep conviction that lay at
the root of his character. As he stood beside
you at his work, his figure relieved against three
or four half-completed designs, it was sometimes
difficult to find the link which joined the lighter
moods of his comradeship with the wistful beauty
of the faces that he sought to image in his
pictures. But almost at the next moment the
difficulty would be solved by a sudden transition
to a graver train of thought, and before either of
us would be well aware of the swift change of
tone, our converse had wandered off to the consideration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
of some larger ideal of art or life. It
was a unique attraction of Burne-Jones&#8217;s studio
that it nearly always contained a rich and varied
record of his work, for the chosen method of his
painting rendered it necessary for him to keep
several pictures in almost equal states of progress,
each being put aside in turn till the surface of
pigment was so fixed and hardened as to render
it ready for the added layer of colour which was
to form the next stage in its progress.</p>

<p>Very often on these occasions our talk was
not directly concerned with painting at all, but
strayed away into many worlds of the present
or the past. As a painter every artist must
stand or fall by his command of the particular
aspect of beauty which can be rendered by that
art, and by no other. If a picture fails, it is
no excuse that its author is a poet. If a poet
fails, it is idle to plead in his defence that
he is an accomplished musician. What added
burdens of the spirit the worker in any art
chooses to carry, concerns himself alone; what
concerns the world is that the result&mdash;whatever
other message it may undertake to convey&mdash;must
be perfect according to the laws of the
medium he has chosen. In speaking, therefore,
of the deep poetic impulse that lay at the back
of all Burne-Jones&#8217;s achievement in design, I
have no thought of seeking to rest the reputation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
which he will ultimately hold upon any other
considerations than those which are proper to
the field in which he laboured. He has left
enough, and more than enough, to vindicate
his high claim to rank among the masters of
art, but it is certain, none the less, that his
profound interest in those other fields of expression
in which the imagination finds utterance,
gave him infinite charm as a man.</p>

<p>There was little lovable in literature that he
did not keenly love, though in regard to the
literature of the past, I think his heart turned
by preference to the legendary beauty of the
earlier romances, where the story, freshly emerging
from its mythical form, may still be captured
with equal right of possession by the poet, the
musician, or the painter. Great drama, even
the drama of Shakespeare, never so strongly
appealed to him; and, indeed, I have always
noticed in my companionship with painters that
in their judgment of the work of the theatre
what is most essentially dramatic in drama is
not, as a rule, that upon which their imagination
most eagerly fixes itself. And yet, in the case
of Burne-Jones, it was curious to observe that
among the narrative writers of our time the
highly dramatised work of Charles Dickens
most strongly appealed to him. For Dickens&#8217;s
genius, its pathos, not less than its humour, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
owned an unbounded admiration; and I suppose
there were few of the worshippers of the great
novelist, except, perhaps, Mr. Swinburne, who
could boast so full and so complete a knowledge
of his work. The sense of humour, which was
a dominating quality in the character of Burne-Jones,
could, perhaps, scarcely be surmised by
those who know the man only through his
painting. His claims in this regard, which
could not be ignored by those who knew him,
must always be received with a sense of surprise&mdash;even
of incredulity&mdash;by those to whom he
was a stranger. And yet, when he was so
minded, his pencil could give proof of it in
many essays in caricature; while in conversation
it was an ever-present quality that lay in wait
for the fit occasion.</p>

<p>When Burne-Jones spoke of his own art it
was always with complete understanding of its
many and divergent ideals, and I have heard
him appraise at its true value the genius of
men with whom he himself had little in
common. Among his contemporaries he could
speak with generous appreciation of the great
gifts of Millais, and of the acknowledged masters
of the past. However little their ideals sorted
with his own, his power of appreciation was too
liberal and too keen to permit him to ignore
or to belittle their claims though his heart&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
abiding-place was as I have said with the
Florentines of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>My visits to Burne-Jones&#8217;s studio began very
early in our acquaintance, and the several errands
which took me there varied as time went on.
While he was painting his picture of King
Cophetua, he asked that my eldest son&mdash;who
was then a child&mdash;should be allowed to serve
as model for one of the heads in the picture.
I am afraid that, like most children, my boy
gave some trouble to the master, who one day
rebuked him as being an incorrigibly bad sitter,
and the boy, who had been kept standing during
the whole of the morning, promptly replied
with the indignant inquiry as to whether Burne-Jones
called standing sitting&mdash;a response that
immensely delighted the painter himself, who
recognised the justice of the claim by at once
releasing him from further service for the day.
At a later time I saw much of him in his studio
while he was designing the scenery and costumes
for my play of <i>King Arthur</i>. I read him the
play one afternoon while he was at work upon
his own great design of King Arthur&#8217;s sleep in
Avalon, in the lower studio, which stood at the
foot of his garden; and the task, which he
straightway accepted, of assisting in the production
of the drama at the Lyceum Theatre,
led to many later meetings, at which our talk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
turned constantly on that great cycle of romance&mdash;one
phase of which I had sought to illustrate.</p>

<p>His own mind was steeped in their beauty,
as may be seen in his constant recurrence to
these legends as chosen subjects for his design,
and I fancy it was their common love for this
subject in romance which formed one of the
strongest links of fellowship between himself
and William Morris. I have said that to
Rossetti he always confessed his deep obligations
as an artist, but there can, I think, be little
doubt that of all living comrades it was Morris
whom he most loved. Though, as he has
himself confessed, they had parted company in
regard to some of the problems that beset the
artist, in the graver issues of life, no less than
in the lighter moods of social comradeship, they
were at one to the end. He told me that once
in the earlier days of their association they had
gone with Charles Faulkner on a boating excursion
up the Thames. At that time Morris
was apprehensive that he was growing too stout,
and at one of the river inns where they had to
share the same room the painter conceived the
mischievous idea of unduly alarming the poet as
to his condition. Morris had retired earlier
than the others, and was fast asleep, when
Burne-Jones, having procured a needle and
thread from the landlady, took a large slice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
out of the lining of his companion&#8217;s waistcoat,
and then sewed the two sides together as neatly
as he could. In the morning Morris was up
betimes, and Burne-Jones, still feigning to be
asleep, watched with eager excitement the terror
and consternation with which the poet sought,
in vain, to make the shrivelled garment meet
around his waist. The victim of the plot
fancied that his increasing proportions had
suddenly taken on a miraculous acceleration of
pace, and it was not until the smothered laughter
of the painter greeted his ears that he was
relieved from the panic of anxiety into which
he had been suddenly thrown.</p>

<p>Burne-Jones could sometimes, on occasion,
be himself the victim of a practical joke, and
once when I paid him a sudden and unexpected
visit at his little cottage in Rottingdean, I contrived
to play, very successfully, upon what I
knew to be his horror of the professional interviewer.
I announced myself to the servant as
an American colonel, who had called as the
special correspondent of the <i>Cincinnati Record</i>, and
on the message being conveyed to her master,
she returned, as I expected, with the curt
intimation that he was not at home. But he
evidently felt that no precaution was too great
to be taken in the face of this threatened invasion,
for as I crept by the window that looks out on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
to the little Village green I saw him, in company
with his son, stealthily crawling under the table,
and when I afterwards returned and announced
myself in my own name, he related with childish
delight how skilfully he had avoided the attack
of the enemy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">JAMES M&#8216;NEIL WHISTLER</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> many pleasant hours I spent in Whistler&#8217;s
studio in Cheyne Walk are dominated in recollection
by the striking personality of the
artist. In physical no less than in mental
equipment, he stood apart from his generation,
and the characteristic peculiarities of his appearance,
joined to the marked idiosyncrasy of his
temperament, must remain unforgettable to all
who knew him. It is easy indeed to recall the
tones of the sometimes strident voice as he let
slip some barbed shaft in ruthless characterisation
of one or other of his contemporaries: easier
still to summon again, as though he stood before
me now, the oddly fashioned figure, lithe and
muscular, yet finely delicate in its outline, as he
skipped to and fro in front of his canvas, now
with brush poised in the air between those long
slender fingers, seeming, as he gazed at the
model, to challenge the supremacy of nature,
now passing swiftly to the easel to lay on that
single touch of colour that was to record his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
victory. It is not so easy, however, to convey
in words the intellectual impression left by the
agile movement of his mind, as it leaped in
sudden transition from the graver utterance of
some pregnant thought concerning the immutable
laws of his art, to those lighter sallies of wit
and humour that found their readiest and most
congenial exercise in the half-playful, half-malicious
portraiture of men we both knew.</p>

<p>So notable indeed and so notorious became
the sayings of Whistler, uttered in such moods
of laughing irony, that the more deeply serious
side of his nature was apt in his own time to be
ignored or even denied. And for this he himself
was partly to blame. His own manifest enjoyment
in the free play of a ready and relentless
wit was apt sometimes to obscure that deeper
insight into the essential principles of the art he
practised, to which no one on occasion could
give a finer or more subtle expression.</p>

<p>No one, surely, perceived more clearly that
there is in every art an essential quality born of
its material and resting with instinctive security
upon its special resources and limitations, without
which it can make no lasting claim to recognition.
He never forgot that the painter or
the poet who ventures to take upon himself
added burthens of the spirit which he is unable
to subdue to the conditions of the medium in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
which he works, can find no just defence for the
violation of any of the conditions the chosen
vehicle imposes, by an appeal to the intellectual
or emotional value of the ideas he has sought to
express. He looked perhaps with even excessive
suspicion upon the interpretation through painting
of subjects that suggested any sort of reliance
upon the modes appropriate to other arts, with
the result that the effects he achieved bear sometimes
too strongly the stamp of calculated effort.
Science was a word he was very fond of employing
with regard to painting, and though it
implied a just rebuke to those who were wont
to make a merely sentimental appeal, it sometimes
fettered his own processes and left upon
some of the work he produced rather the sense
of a protest against the false ideals of others than
of the free and spontaneous enjoyment of the
beauty in nature that he intended to convey.</p>

<p>But an artist, after all, is either something
better or something worse than his theories, and
Whistler was infinitely better. His instinct was
sure, and within the limits he assigned to himself
he moved with faultless security of taste. If
the realm he conquered was not over richly
furnished it was at any rate kept jealously free
from the intrusion of inappropriate elements.
Whatever was admitted there had an indisputable
right to its artistic existence, and while he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
excluded much that other men, differently gifted,
might equally have subdued to the conditions he
was so careful to obey, such beauty as he found
in nature was at least always of a kind that
painting alone could fitly render.</p>

<p>To watch Whistler at work in his studio was
quickly to forget that he had any theories at all.
Nothing certainly could less resemble the assured
processes of science than his own tentative and
sometimes even timid practice; for although the
result, when it received the final stamp of his
approval, seemed often slight and was always
free from the evidence of labour, labour most
surely had not been absent, for the ultimate
shape given to his design, though it may have
represented in itself only a brief period employed
in its execution, had in many cases been preceded
by unwearying experiment and by many a misdirected
adventure that never reached completion
at all.</p>

<p>Whistler&#8217;s talk in the studio was not often
concerned with the subject of Art, and even when
Art was the topic it was nearly always his own.
His admiration of the genius he unquestionably
possessed was unstinted and sincere, and if he
avoided any prolonged discussion of the competing
claims of his contemporaries, it was, I
think, in the unfeigned belief that they deserved
no larger consideration. He had his chosen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
heroes among the masters of the past, but they
were few, and their superior pretensions, in his
judgment, were so manifest that it seemed
sufficient to him to announce their supremacy
without further parley as to the inferior claims
of their fellows. The position they occupied
in his regard was as little open to argument as
the place of incontestable superiority he was
wont to assign to himself in his own generation.
I remember once, when a friend in his presence
rashly ventured to accuse him of a lack of
catholicity in taste, Whistler in swift response
admitted the justice of the charge and excused
himself on the ground that he only liked what
was good.</p>

<p>But there were causes, apart from the convinced
egotism of his nature, which led him by
preference towards other topics of conversation.
He has written in his lectures and in his letters
both wisely and wittily of the proper mission of
painting; so wittily, indeed, that his humour
and satire are apt sometimes to obscure the
sound and serious thought which, on this subject,
coloured even his most playful utterances. For,
underlying all he said or wrote, was a conviction
he took no pains to conceal&mdash;that the principles
of Art, together with its aims and ideals, were
the proper concern only of artists and could
scarcely be debated without impropriety by that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
larger and profaner circle whose praise and
appreciation, however, he was by no means
disposed to resent. At times he was even
greedy of applause, and provided it was full and
emphatic enough, showed no inclination to
question its source or authority. There were
moments, indeed, when, if it appeared to lack
volume or vehemence, he was ready himself to
supply what was deficient.</p>

<p>It was partly therefore upon principle that
he forbore to discuss at any length subjects with
which he deemed the layman had no proper
concern; partly also because in intimate conversation
his innate and powerful sense of
humour so loved to assert itself that he wandered,
by preference, into fields where it found unfettered
play. And so it happened in the long
and intimate talks in the studio, while he was
at his work, he loved to speak of things that
belonged to the outer world, and to let his wit
play vividly, sometimes mischievously and even
maliciously, upon the qualities and foibles of his
friends. Here he was never reticent, and so
relentless were his raillery and his sarcasm that
one was sometimes tempted to think that his
acquaintances, and even his friends, only existed
for the purpose of displaying his powers of
attack and annihilation. I remember very well,
when he was decorating what afterwards became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
known as the &#8220;Peacock Room&#8221; in Mr. Leyland&#8217;s
house, that I used often to visit him at his work,
and sometimes shared with him the picnic meals
which a devoted satellite would prepare for
him in the empty mansion. He was certainly
very proud of the elaborate scheme of blue and
gold ornament he had devised, but I believe
this unalloyed admiration of his own achievement
was scarcely so great or so keen as his
delighted anticipation of the owner&#8217;s shock of
surprise when he should return to discover that
the handsome and costly stamped leather, which
originally adorned the walls of the apartment,
had been completely effaced to make room for
the newly fashioned pattern of decoration. He
already scented the joy of the battle that impended,
and this added a peculiar zest to his
labours in the accomplishment of a purely
artistic task. As he had hoped so indeed it
happened, and in the long controversy and
conflict that ensued, he found, I believe, the most
perfect and unalloyed satisfaction.</p>

<p>His nature, in short, at every stage of his
career was impishly militant, and whereas other
men are so constituted as to desire peace at any
price, there was with Whistler scarcely any
cost he deemed too great to secure a hostile
encounter. To baulk him of a controversy was
to rob him of his peace of mind, and so deeply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
implanted in him was the fighting spirit that he
was sometimes only half-conscious of the wounds
he inflicted. Certain it is that, the lists once
entered, he was relentless in attack, and availed
himself without scruple of any weapon that
came to his hand. And yet even in his most
saturnine sallies there was an underlying sense
of humour that yielded to the onlooker at least
a part of the enjoyment that he himself drew
from the encounter; while his after recital of the
tortuous ingenuity with which he had whipped a
harmless misunderstanding into a grave estrangement
was always irresistible in its appeal.</p>

<p>But though pitiless in combat, Whistler was
not without a chivalrous side to his nature. He
was fond enough, to use his own expression, of
&#8220;collecting scalps,&#8221; but his tomahawk was never
employed against members of the gentler sex.
His manner towards women was unfailingly
courteous and even deferential. In their
company he laid aside the weapons of war,
exhibiting towards them on all occasions a
delicacy of sympathy and perception which they
instinctively recognised and appreciated. It set
them at their ease. They felt they could listen
with interest and amusement to his recital of
those fearless and sometimes savage contests with
the male, in complete security from any danger
of the war being carried into their own country.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
They were conscious, in his presence, of an
enduring truce between the sexes: a truce so
artfully established and so chivalrously conceded
as to arouse no suspicion that they were being
treated with the indulgence due to inferiors.
There was, indeed, in his own character and
personality something of the charm, something
also of the weakness, that is commonly supposed
to be exclusively feminine. The alertness of
his temperament betrayed an intuitive quickness
in identifying himself with the mood of the
moment that found in them a ready response;
and his natural vanity, though it might sometimes
seem overpowering to members of his
own sex, was so exercised as to leave no doubt
that he still held in reserve a full measure of the
admiration which was due to theirs.</p>

<p>Even as a craftsman there was something
delicately feminine in Whistler&#8217;s modes of work.
I have often watched him at his own printing-press
when he was preparing a plate of one of
his etchings, and it was always fascinating to
follow the deft and agile movements of his hands
as he inked the surface of the copper and then,
with successive touches, graduated the varying
force of the impression to be taken. Here, as I
used to think, his method seemed more assured,
his alliance with the mechanical resources of his
art more confident, than when he was struggling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
with the subtler and more complex problems
of colour.</p>

<p>I have already spoken of those physical peculiarities
with which he had been liberally endowed
by nature. They were such as to make him a
marked figure in any company in which he
appeared, and, so far from being a source of
embarrassment to himself, he regarded them as
a substantial asset to be carefully cultivated and
artfully obtruded upon public notice. He even
went so far as to enforce and emphasise what
there was of inherited eccentricity in his personal
appearance. The single tuft of white hair which
lay embedded in the coiling black locks adorning
his brow, he regarded with a special complacency
and pride; and I was amused one evening in
Cheyne Walk, while I watched him dressing for
dinner, to observe the infinite pains he bestowed
upon this particular item of his toilet. It was
already past the hour when we should both
have been seated at our friend&#8217;s table, but this
fact in no way abbreviated the care with which
he cultivated and arranged this unique feature
in his appearance.</p>

<p>And yet it would be wrong, perhaps, to
ascribe the delay only to vanity, because to be
late for dinner was with Whistler almost a
religion. Certain it was, however, that he took
a childish delight in any little studied departures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
from the rules of ordinary costume. At one
time he ostentatiously abandoned the white neck-tie
which was the accepted accompaniment of
evening dress; at another, a delicate wand-like
cane was deemed to be a necessary ornament to
be carried in his walks abroad; and yet again
he would announce an approved change in fashion
by appearing in a pair of spotless white ducks
beneath his long black frock-coat. These calculated
eccentricities induced in the minds of the
crowd the conviction that Whistler deliberately
sought a cheap notoriety, and it must be
conceded, even by those who recognised the
serious side of his nature, that he exhibited at
times a strange blend of the man of genius and
the showman. And yet this admission might
easily be made to convey a false impression.
He was in a sense both the one and the other,
but their separate functions were never merged
or confused. Till his task as an artist was completed
no man was more serious in his purpose
or more exacting or fastidious in the demands
he made upon himself. There was nothing of
the charlatan in that part of him which he
dedicated to his work; and it was not until the
artist was satisfied that he availed himself of
such antics as attracted, and perhaps were designed
to attract, the astonished attention of the public.</p>

<p>One charge that was often urged against him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
by his enemies, arose out of the singular choice
of titles for his pictures. But it was not, I think,
in any spirit of affectation that he elected to
describe some of his works in terms only strictly
appropriate to music. His &#8220;Harmonies&#8221; and
his &#8220;Nocturnes,&#8221; though they seemed at the
time to indicate a certain wilful perversity, had
in reality a true relation to principles in Art
which he was earnestly seeking to establish. It
has been rightly held of music that, in its detachment
from the things of the intellect and its
independence of defined human emotion, it stands
as a model to all other modes of expression
by its jealous guardianship of those indefinable
qualities which are of the essence of Art itself.
And in a sense it may be said of Whistler that
he discharged a like function in the realm of
painting. For all appeal made through other
means than those strictly belonging to the chosen
medium he had neither sympathy nor pity. It
was for the incommunicable element in painting,
incommunicable save through the unassisted
resources of painting itself, that he was constantly
striving, and it was his revolt against all alien
pretensions that led him to seek and to adopt
the analogy of music wherein the saving efficacy
of such elements is never questioned.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE ENGLISH SCHOOL OF PAINTING<br />
AT THE ROMAN EXHIBITION<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor"><small>[1]</small></a></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> British Section of the International Fine Arts
Exhibition, to the study of which these pages are
designed to serve as introduction, may claim
to possess one or two features of exceptional
interest. It is the first time that in any exhibition
held outside the British Isles a serious
endeavour has been made to illustrate the progressive
movement of the English school of
painting. The works of English painters have
time and again been shown in the different
capitals of Europe, and it is no longer possible
to allege that the masters whose achievements
we prize are unknown beyond the limits of our
own shores. But the present occasion is the first
wherein a serious and successful experiment has
been made to render the chosen examples of the
art of the past truly representative of the birth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
and growth of modern art in England and of the
distinctive developments of style which have
marked its history. And it is peculiarly fitting
that this connected panorama of English art
should be offered in the capital of a kingdom
to whose example the art of every land has at
some time owned its indebtedness. If it be true
that every road leads to Rome, it is no less true
that, since the dawn of the Renaissance, the footsteps
of the artists of all northern lands have
worn the several ways that make for Italy; and
it will be seen, as we come to trace the story of
painting in England, that, not only in its earlier
appeal but again and again in the successive
revolutions of style and method that have marked
its progress, it has found renewed encouragement
and fresh inspiration in the splendid and varied
achievements of the great Italian masters, from
Giotto to Michael Angelo, from Bellini to
Tintoretto.</p>

<p>The history of painting in England precedes
by more than a century the history of English
painting. The force of the Reformation had
unquestionably the effect of suddenly snapping
the artistic tradition. At an earlier time England
could boast of a race of artists who, as the
illuminated manuscripts of the period clearly
show, were able to hold their own with the
most perfect masters in that kind that Europe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
could show; but with the advent of the Reformation
the imaginative impulse of our people
found a different channel. The strength of our
Renaissance sought expression in our literature,
and for a considerable period we became and
remained indebted for all expression of pictorial
design to a race of foreign artists who enjoyed
the hospitality of our land. Even before the
Reformation was complete Holbein had found
a home at the English Court, and at a later
period Rubens and his great pupil Van Dyck
were invited to our shores. They brought with
them to England the great tradition in portraiture
that may be traced back to Italy&mdash;a
tradition having its spring in the style and
practice of the masters of Venice, whose devotion
to Nature survived as an inheritance to Northern
Europe when the more imaginative design of
the school of Florence had fallen into decay.</p>

<p>It may be said of all modern art in whatever
land we follow its story, that its master currents
flow in the direction of portrait and landscape,
and it was in these twin streams that the English
school, when a century later it came into
being, was destined to prove its acknowledged
supremacy. But the realistic spirit which from
the first had stamped itself upon the great
Venetians, even at a period when they seemed
to be labouring wholly or mainly in the service<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
of religion, had gathered in its passage towards
our shores yet another impulse, which found its
first expression in the art of the Low Countries.</p>

<p>Of the painting of <i>genre</i>&mdash;that art which
dwells lovingly upon the illustration of the social
manners of the time&mdash;there is already a hint
even in Venice itself; but it was in Holland
that it first claimed a separate and secure existence;
and it was to the examples in this kind,
perfected by the Dutch masters, that we owe
the achievement of the great painter who may
be claimed as the founder of the modern English
school. That school may be said, indeed, to
date from the birth of William Hogarth.
English painters&mdash;not a few&mdash;had practised
before his time, but their work only followed,
without rivalling, that of foreign contemporaries
under whose influence they laboured. Hogarth
was the first who by the independence of his
genius gave the seal and stamp of national
character to the pictorial illustration of the
manners of his age. It was the fashion at one
time to dwell almost exclusively upon Hogarth&#8217;s
qualities as a satirist, to the neglect of those
more enduring claims which are now conceded
to him as a great master of the art he professed;
but the criticism of a later time has repaired
that injustice, and Hogarth takes his place now
not merely in virtue of the social message he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
sought to convey, but even more by reason of
his great qualities as a colourist and a master of
tone. Not that we need underrate or ignore
those dramatic elements by which he still makes
so strong an appeal to our admiration. It is
rare enough, even among the supreme painters
of <i>genre</i>, to find so faithful, so penetrating an
insight into character. Of all the great Dutchmen
whom he succeeded Jan Steen alone can,
in this particular, claim to be his rival; and
although the English school is specially rich in
the class of composition which his genius and
invention had initiated, there are none of all those
who have practised in a later day who would
not still own him as their master.</p>

<p>The two examples secured for the present
exhibition show Hogarth at his best, both as a
painter and as an inventor. &#8220;The Lady&#8217;s Last
Stake&#8221;&mdash;contributed by Mr. Pierpont Morgan&mdash;even
when our admiration has been glutted
by the rich evidence it affords of Hogarth&#8217;s
unrivalled control of a kind of truth that might
have found expression in an art other than the
art of the painter, still draws from us the
unstinted homage due to a great colourist whose
chosen tints are submitted with unfailing skill
to every delicate and subtle gradation of tone;
while in &#8220;The Card Party,&#8221; lent by Sir
Frederick Cook, where these qualities are not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
less clearly announced, we are left at leisure to
follow and appreciate the unflagging observation
which registers every detail that serves for the
dramatic presentation of the chosen theme.</p>

<p>From the time of Hogarth to our own day
this particular style, which he may claim to
have originated, has never lacked professors.
As it passed into the hands of Wilkie satire is
softened by sympathy, the foibles of character
are touched with a gentler and more tender
spirit, and the adroitly ordered groups, with
which he sometimes loves to crowd his canvas,
tell, in their final impression, of the presence of
a kind of sentiment, sometimes perhaps even of
a measure of sentimentalism, which scarcely
came within the range of Hogarth&#8217;s fiercer
survey of life. And, again, in the later work
of Orchardson sentiment and satire have both
yielded to another ambition that was content
to render with unfailing sympathy and distinction
of style the finer graces of social life. In the
superb picture of &#8220;The Young Duke&#8221; we may
note how clearly the gifts of the painter dominate
the scene, his eye ever on the alert for the
opportunities of rich and delicate harmonies
supplied by every chosen accessory of costume
and furniture; and no less eager to exhibit and
to record by means of the subtle resources of
his art those finer shades of social breeding that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
the subject suggests. In this power of granting
a nameless dignity to the art of <i>genre</i>&mdash;a dignity
resident in the painter which by some strange
magic he contrives to confer upon the people of
his creation&mdash;Sir William Orchardson sometimes
recalls the art of Watteau, who indeed remains
unrivalled in his power to perceive and his
ability to register those slighter realities of gesture
and bearing which give to the rendering of
trivial things a distinction which only style
can bestow.</p>

<p>It is interesting to turn from this characteristic
example of Sir William Orchardson&#8217;s style
to the work of an elder contemporary in the
person of Frith. The two artists&mdash;though both
may be said to be engaged in the same task&mdash;make
a widely contrasted appeal. With the
former, whatever other message he may intend
to convey, the claims of the painter stand foremost.
We are conscious of the controlling influence
of the colourist and the master of
pictorial composition before we are permitted
to study or to enjoy the human realities that he
has chosen to depict. With Frith, on the other
hand, it is the human element in the design that
first arrests our attention. Gifts of a purely
artistic kind he undoubtedly possessed, as the
example here exhibited sufficiently proves&mdash;gifts
which at one time criticism tended to ignore or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
to undervalue; but it remains finally true nevertheless
that it is as a student of manners, presented
in a form sometimes recalling the arts of the
theatre, that Frith makes his first appeal to our
attention. In this respect he claims kinship with
Hogarth himself, whose influence, I doubt not,
he would have been proud to acknowledge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Coming of Age in the Olden Time,&#8221; necessitating,
by the choice of its subject, the employment
of historic costume, illustrates only one
aspect of Frith&#8217;s varied talent, and he will
perhaps be best remembered by such works as
&#8220;The Railway Station&#8221; and &#8220;Ramsgate Sands,&#8221;
where he is called upon to render with unflinching
fidelity those facts of contemporary dress in
which painters differently gifted find no picturesque
opportunity; and whatever may be Time&#8217;s
final judgment upon Frith&#8217;s claim in the region
of pure art, it cannot be questioned that such
richly peopled canvases must for ever remain
an invaluable record of the outward realities of
the generation for which he labored.</p>

<p>The historic side of <i>genre</i> painting is further
illustrated in the present collection in the person
of Maclise, who, like his great forerunner,
William Hogarth, was attracted again and again
by the art of the theatre. But Maclise brought
to his task certain larger qualities of design and
composition which he had won from the study<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
of the great masters of style; and although he
never achieved the highest triumphs in the
region of the ideal his efforts in that direction
left an impress upon his painting that served to
distinguish it from the achievements of those
who laboured in obedience to a more modest
tradition.</p>

<p>The English theatre has attracted the talent
of a long line of artists, some of whom, like
Clint, are little known in any other sphere.
Perhaps the greatest of them all (if we except
the name of Hogarth himself) was Johann
Zoffany, whose paintings, admirable in the
rendering of incident and character, are even
more remarkable for his great qualities as a
colourist and his perfect mastery over the secrets
of tone. As a student of the theatre he may
perhaps be seen to best advantage in the several
fine examples in the possession of the Garrick
Club; but Lord O&#8217;Hagan&#8217;s picture of Charles
Townley the collector, presented in his library
with his marbles, asserts with convincing force
his right to rank among the great painters of his
time.</p>

<p>Among other pictures in this category whose
high claims deserve a fulness of consideration
which the exigencies of space alone forbid me
to grant, I may mention the Eastern study by
Lewis, the &#8220;Dawn&#8221; by E. J. Gregory, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
group of Sir Peter and Lady Teazle by John
Pettie.</p>

<p>I have hinted already that in the brief story
of our national school of painting we are constantly
reminded of the abiding splendours of the
art of Italy, and even in the work of men whose
genuine victories were won in another sphere
there are constant echoes of the larger language
moulded by the great masters of the south. For
although, at the first, it is only in the allied
departments of portrait and landscape that the
art of England claims and owns unquestioned
supremacy, yet in the career of the gifted painter
who may be said to have first firmly established
our claim to rank among the schools of Europe
we are not allowed to forget the glorious victories
of the Italian Renaissance.</p>

<p>It has been sometimes alleged of Sir Joshua
Reynolds&#8217;s occasional experiments in the grand
style that their failure to rival the masters he
most admired proves how futile were his studies
in that branch of art in which he could never
hope to excel. But this, I think, is to take only
a shallow and superficial view of the factors that
make for excellence in any chosen field of artistic
endeavour; for if Sir Joshua&#8217;s essays in ideal
design now fade into insignificance by comparison
with the solid and enduring work he achieved
in portraiture, it remains none the less true that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
the study of those great models towards which
his ambition led him has served to grant to
his interpretation of individual face and form
a measure of added dignity and power that could
have been won from no other source. His
sketch-book&mdash;preserved in the Print Room of
the British Museum&mdash;while it forms an interesting
record of his sojourn in Italy is no less instructive
as illustrating his untiring devotion to
those great masters who laboured in a realm of
art that his own genius was never destined to
inhabit; and there is something infinitely touching
in the concluding sentences of his valedictory
address to the students of the Royal Academy
wherein, while frankly confessing his own failure,
he reiterates his undiminished admiration of the
greatest of the great Florentines. &#8220;It will not,&#8221;
he says, &#8220;I hope, be thought presumptuous in
me to appear in the train, I cannot say of his
imitators, but of his admirers. I have taken
another course, one more suited to my abilities
and to the tastes of the time in which I live.
Yet, however unequal I feel myself to that
attempt, were I now to begin the world again
I would tread in the steps of that great master.
To kiss the hem of his garment, to catch the
slightest of his perfections, would be glory and
distinction enough for an ambitious man. I feel
a self-congratulation in knowing myself capable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
of such sensations as he intended to excite. I
reflect, not without vanity, that these discourses
bear testimony of my admiration of that truly
divine man; and I desire that the last words I
should pronounce in this academy and from this
place might be the name of Michael Angelo.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the same year in which these words were
uttered there is yet another reference to his
earlier ambitions which is scarcely less pathetic.
Writing to Sheridan, who desired to purchase
the beautiful picture of St. Cecilia, for which
Mrs. Sheridan had served as the model, he says:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is with great regret that I part with the
best picture I ever painted; for though I have
every year hoped to paint better and better, and
may truly say &#8216;Nil actum reputans dum quid
superesset agendum,&#8217; it has not been always the
case. However, there is now an end of the
pursuit; the race is over, whether it is won or
lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>The judgment of Time has left the land
that owned him in no doubt that the race had
been worthily won. The prize awarded to him
by the acclaim of subsequent generations was
not perhaps the prize he coveted the most; and
yet if the goal towards which he set his feet was
never reached, the time spent in the study of the
great masters of the past affords no story of wasted
ambition. For without the example of those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
great masters he loved to study, his own achievement
would have been shorn of certain elements
of greatness which have served to place him
foremost in the ranks of the portrait painters
of his time.</p>

<p>In certain styles of painting we are rightly
modest in asserting the claims of the English
school, but in that goodly list of artists at whose
head stands the name of Sir Joshua we may
boast a national possession which the art of the
time could scarcely rival and most assuredly
could not surpass. Europe was then in no mood
to take over the rich inheritance of the great
Florentines; the successful study of the principles
they had expounded had to wait the coming
of a later day; but in those departments wherein
the art of Europe was still vital England certainly
was, at that time, not lagging behind her rivals.
Reynolds, Gainsborough, Romney, Hoppner,
Raeburn&mdash;what names in the contemporary art
of the Continent can be cited as their superiors
in those branches of painting which they cultivated?
Disparagement is no part of the business
of criticism, and the victories of one land assuredly
take nothing from the triumphs justly
won in another. France, too, at that epoch
could boast gifted artists greatly distinguished
in various fields; but when it is remembered
that Watteau, the most distinguished of French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
colourists, had died two years before Reynolds
was born, the outburst of artistic activity, which
the men whose names I have cited heralded to
the world, may well be viewed as a phenomenon
almost unparalleled in the modern history of
painting. For it is as colourists, in the truest
and highest sense of the term, that the English
school at this period of revival makes its claim
to supremacy; and it was here that the teaching
of Italy&mdash;not as expounded through the work
of the Florentines, but rather as it travelled northwards,
carrying with it the surviving splendours
of the Venetians&mdash;found a full and worthy
response from these gifted exponents of our
native art.</p>

<p>The present collection is rich in finely chosen
examples of the masters I have named. Reynolds
boasted to Malone that he had painted two
generations of the beauties of England, and as we
turn from the &#8220;Kitty Fisher,&#8221; lent by the Earl of
Crewe, to the portrait of &#8220;Anne Dashwood,&#8221; or
to that of the &#8220;Marchioness of Thomond,&#8221; from
Sir Carl Meyer&#8217;s collection, we may well own
that no man was more rightly equipped for the
task that had fallen upon him. No man save
perhaps his rival, Thomas Gainsborough, who,
in the alertness and delicacy of his observation
as well as by a natural affinity with the gentler
sex that was born of a sweet and gracious disposition,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
seemed specially destined to interpret
with loving fidelity the lightest no less than the
most characteristic realities of feminine beauty.
In weight and dignity of style, the outcome, as
I have already hinted, of a diligent study of
the great models of the past, in masculine grip
and gravity of interpretation, displayed more
especially in the portraiture of the most distinguished
men of his time, Reynolds, it must
be conceded, remains even to this day without
a rival in our school. But in the native gifts
of a painter Gainsborough owned no superior,
and it would be difficult to trace to any individual
master of the past, or indeed to any other
source than his inborn love of nature, those
peculiar qualities of sweetness and grace which
set the finest achievements of his brush in a
category of their own. A measure of kinship
with the great Dutchmen may be discerned in
his earlier essays in landscape&mdash;a branch of art
which he may be said almost to have founded in
England; and the final words with which he
took leave of the world, &#8220;We are all going to
heaven and Van Dyck is of the company,&#8221; give
warrant for the belief that even in portraiture
he would willingly have owned his allegiance
to the famous pupil of Rubens; but in his actual
practice as a portrait painter his own modest
and yet commanding personality quickly effaced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
all record of indebtedness to any other influence
than his own inspiration.</p>

<p>It would be easy, if space permitted, to
institute an interesting comparison between his
own accomplishment and that of his contemporary
Sir Joshua. The same personalities sometimes
figure upon the canvases of both. The winning
beauty of Miss Linley&#8217;s face, employed by Sir
Joshua in his picture of St. Cecilia, had no less
strongly attracted the genius of Gainsborough; and
here, as well as in the rendering of the features of
Mrs. Siddons, we may note the divergent gifts
which these painters separately brought to their
task and the varying and matchless qualities
which nature surrendered ungrudgingly to both.
Speaking generally, it may, I think, be conceded
that Gainsborough&#8217;s art registered with greater
felicity those fleeting graces of gesture and expression
that would sometimes escape his more
serious rival; while Reynolds, constantly preoccupied
by the intellectual appeal made by his
sitter, was perhaps more apt to dwell in the
features he portrayed upon those deeper and
more permanent truths that would serve to
mirror mind and character.</p>

<p>That Gainsborough&#8217;s vision was not, however,
limited to forms of female beauty is shown
clearly enough by the several notable examples
here exhibited. His portraits of John Eld and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
Dr. William Pearce, no less than the head of
the artist himself, prove that he could acquit
himself nobly even when he was not engaged
in the more sympathetic task of presenting with
faultless grace the lovely women of his time;
while Lord Jersey&#8217;s &#8220;Landscape and Cattle&#8221;
affords sufficient evidence of what the school of
English landscape owes to his initiative.</p>

<p>Of the other distinguished masters of portrait
in the century in which these two great names
stand pre-eminent we find here adequate representation.
Romney is not always faultless as
a colourist, nor does his draughtsmanship yield
the searching penetration displayed by Reynolds
or the more delicate apprehension of the finer
facts of expression which constitutes so large a
part of Gainsborough&#8217;s ineffable charm; but
judged at his best, and art may justly appeal
against any less generous verdict, he takes his
rightful place by the side of both. How good
was his best may be seen in Mr. Pierpont
Morgan&#8217;s fine full-length of Mrs. Scott Jackson,
as well as in the group of Mrs. Clay and her
child, lent by Mrs. Fleischmann. But Romney
had one sitter whose beauty overpowered all
others in the appeal it made to the artist, and
it is therefore fortunate that the collection
includes a portrait of Lady Hamilton, whose
fame may be said to be inseparably linked with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
his own. She, too, in her own person awakens
echoes from Italy, for it was at Rome she won
the admiration of Goethe in those dramatic
assumptions of classical character that are preserved
for succeeding generations in Romney&#8217;s
constantly repeated studies of the face he
worshipped.</p>

<p>From these three commanding personalities,
which yield brightness to the dawn of our
English school of portraiture, we advance by
no inglorious progression to the masters who,
though now deceased, belong of right to our
own day. Hoppner, the younger contemporary
of the men I have named, whose career
carries us into the next century, is here
superbly represented in the contributions from
Mrs. Fleischmann and Lord Darnley. Raeburn
also, whose masculine and sometimes rugged
genius speaks to us with the accent of the north&mdash;Raeburn,
who at the instigation of Sir Joshua
journeyed to Italy to study the great Italian
masters&mdash;is here seen at his best in the splendid
portrait of &#8220;The MacNab,&#8221; lent by Mrs. Baillie-Hamilton;
while near by we find characteristic
examples of the art of his fellow-countrymen,
Allan Ramsay and Andrew Geddes. Sir Thomas
Lawrence may be said to have brought to a close
the tradition established by Reynolds, and his
practice may therefore be held to form a link<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
with the more modern school. His claims here
receive justice in the two portraits lent by Lord
Bathurst and Lord Plymouth; nor is the collection
without worthy specimens of the art of Opie,
whose practice frankly confesses the example and
influence of Sir Joshua himself. Among the
portrait painters of the younger day, in whose
ranks may be counted Frank Holl and Frederick
Sandys, Brough, and Furse, two names stand pre-eminent.
Watts and Millais in their different
appeal register the high-water mark of portraiture
during what may be called the Victorian era.
The former owned in common with Sir Joshua
an unswerving devotion to the great traditions
of Italian painting, and may claim equally with
Sir Joshua to have won for his work in this
kind an imaginative quality legitimately imported
from the study of ideal design. Millais stands
alone. Of both I shall have to speak again in
respect of other claims which their art puts
forward, but the position of Millais as a painter
of portrait is as independent in its appeal as that
of Gainsborough himself.</p>

<p>The incursions into the realm of ideal and
decorative art made by English painters of the
eighteenth century may not be reckoned among
the accepted triumphs of our school. Barry,
Fuseli, and Haydon, all alike inspired by high
ambition and capable, as was shown by their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
untiring devotion and sacrifice in the cause
they had espoused, lacked the means and the
endowment to appear with any solid measure
of success to an age that was in itself unfitted to
receive the message they sought to convey. The
untutored and undisciplined genius of William
Blake affords an isolated example in his time of
a true and deeper understanding of the secrets of
the kind of art which these men vainly pursued;
but even if Blake had possessed more ample
resources as a painter he would none the less
have spoken in a language that was strange to
the temper of his time; and it was reserved for
a later day to forge the means which would
secure a genuine revival of the forgotten glories
of imaginative design.</p>

<p>The movement associated with the name of
the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood stands as a landmark
in the modern history of our school, nor
has it been without lasting influence upon the
art of Europe. In the year 1848, which gave
it birth, the outlook for painting which aimed
at the presentation of any imaginative ideal was
not encouraging. Etty, a painter of genuine
endowment, still survived, and his unquestioned
gifts as a colourist are plainly asserted in the
single example included in the present exhibition;
but the practice of his later years, as
Holman Hunt has justly observed, scarcely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
offered the most fitting model to a young artist
of serious ambition. On the other hand, the
waning accomplishment of men who had passed
their prime cried aloud for the need of a new
return to nature; and the accepted conventions
of style, either in themselves outworn or else
imperfectly revealed by hands enfeebled and
grown old, left the hour ripe for the advent of
that small but greatly gifted group of young men
whose rebel practice was destined to leave so
strong an imprint upon their own and succeeding
generations. It would perhaps be difficult to
find three painters of equal power whose art was
so differently inspired and whose achievement
was destined to take such separate and widely
divergent forms as Holman Hunt, John Millais,
and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, who stand as the
acknowledged heads in this new movement; but
their efforts, at the time of which I am speaking,
were bound together by a common purpose
which prevailed then and has since continued to
keep their names linked together in the modern
history of our English school. In protest against
the fetters imposed upon painting by the tradition
of the past&mdash;fetters that were by common
consent only to be removed by a renewed return
to the facts of nature&mdash;they trod, in the season
of their youth, the same road, although the
ultimate development of their separate personalities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
led them, before many years passed, into
paths widely divergent from one another. To
judge Rossetti&#8217;s talent justly from works collected
on the present occasion we must group together
the examples in oil and water-colour. The religious
phase in his career is indicated by &#8220;The
Annunciation of the Virgin,&#8221; lent by Mrs. Boyce;
while the freedom with which his imagination
afterwards roamed over those great legends already
made memorable in literature is shown by
the &#8220;Mariana&#8221; and the &#8220;Dante meeting Beatrice&#8221;
among the paintings in oil, and perhaps even
more conclusively in the exquisite water-colour
drawing of &#8220;Paolo and Francesca,&#8221; lent by Mr. Davis,
which may be accepted as a capital instance
of his unrivalled power to render the
truths of human passion without violating the
laws inherent in the art he professed. In his
water-colours even more decisively than in his
paintings in oil Rossetti clearly announces his
great claims as a colourist; and his paintings
bear this distinctive mark in their invention of
colour that the ordered harmonies he can command
are not only beautiful in themselves but
that their beauty stands in clear and direct
response to the nature of the chosen subject.
In this regard assuredly neither of the two
men who stand associated with him in the
Pre-Raphaelite movement can claim to be his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
superior. It is perhaps unfortunate for purposes
of comparison that the range of Millais&#8217;s talent is
here not completely represented. &#8220;Sir Isumbras
at the Ford&#8221; is indeed a characteristic example
of his earlier period, though it hardly shows the
qualities he could then command in the same
degree of perfection as would be rendered by
the presence of &#8220;Lorenzo and Isabella&#8221; or of
&#8220;Christ in the Carpenter&#8217;s Shop.&#8221; We have,
on the other hand, in the &#8220;Black Brunswicker&#8221;
a notable example of that transitional period in
Millais&#8217;s art wherein the claims of fancy and
invention and the overmastering gifts of the
realist&mdash;gifts that afterwards availed to set him
as the greatest portrait painter of his time&mdash;are
held in momentary balance; and we may find
herein expressed an element of Millais&#8217;s painting
which had already received supreme embodiment
in the famous picture of &#8220;The Huguenot.&#8221; No
artist of his time&mdash;perhaps no artist of any time&mdash;has
ever excelled him in the rendering of
certain phases of human emotion that transfigure
without disturbing the permanent beauty of
feminine character. This power remained to
him to the end of his career, and it was the
perception of it which caused Watts to write
to him in 1878, in regard to &#8220;The Bride of
Lammermoor,&#8221; which had received deserved
decoration in Paris: &#8220;Lucy Ashton&#8217;s mouth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
is worthy of any number of medals.&#8221; It is
impossible to say in the presence of work of this
kind how much has been contributed by the
model, how much conferred by the artist; but
that the artist&#8217;s share in the result is predominant
is proved by the fact that nobody else has
combined in the same fashion the portraiture
of individual features with the most delicate
suggestion of the emotion that moves them. In
the art of Holman Hunt, always masculine in its
character and marked by the signs of indefatigable
industry, emphasis is so evenly laid upon all
the confluent qualities that contribute to the
result that it is hard to signalise or to describe
the dominating characteristics of his personality.
In his treatment of religious subjects he showed
a constant reverence that nevertheless scarcely
touched the confines of worship; for the same
earnestness of purpose, the same reverent research
of truth, asserts itself no less in whatever subject
engages his brush. Rare qualities of a purely
pictorial kind nearly all his work may claim, and
yet it is not always possible to concede to the
result, however astonishing in its power, that
final seal of beauty without which Art&#8217;s victory
can never be deemed absolutely complete. &#8220;The
Scapegoat,&#8221; here exhibited, was fiercely disputed
at the date of his first appearance, and it is even
now not difficult to understand that its appeal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
must have seemed strange to the temper of the
time; but there can be no barrier at any rate to
the generous appreciation of the noble qualities
displayed in the &#8220;Finding of the Saviour in the
Temple&#8221; or the austere simplicity and sincerity
of &#8220;Morning Prayer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Around these three men who bravely heralded
the new movement in English art are grouped
the names of others who in different degrees
were equally inspired by the principles the
Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood sought to enforce.
For although their earlier efforts encountered
bitter attack from the accredited organs of
public opinion, they met at the outset with
warm response from within the ranks of art
itself. The company of their followers at first,
indeed, was small; but the quickened spirit of
the time had already been in part prepared for
the reception of the message they bore. The
writings of John Ruskin, in whatever degree his
particular judgments upon art matters may be
disputed, had already availed to stir the conscience
of his generation and to restore to art its rightful
place in life. Henceforth it was not possible to
think of painting as a thing of mere dilettantism,
serving only to minister to the trivial demands
of the taste of the hour. He proved to the
world that at every season when art has held a
dominating place its spirit has been fast linked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
with the heart and life of the people; and the
deep earnestness which in <i>Modern Painters</i>
he brought to the task of historical criticism
found a ready reflex in the more serious and
concentrated intensity of feeling which coloured
the work of men of the younger school.</p>

<p>William Dyce, by his declared devotion to
the painters of the Quattrocento, had already
in part anticipated the practice of the Pre-Raphaelites;
and Ford Madox Brown, here
represented both as a painter of portrait and as
a master of design, though never formally
enrolled in the brotherhood, claims by the inherent
qualities of his work a prominent place
in the revolution that was then in progress. He
had been Rossetti&#8217;s first master, and to the end
of his life, as I can testify, Rossetti retained for
him the warmest affection, and Holman Hunt&#8217;s
somewhat ungracious protest that the direction
of his art would have clashed with the aims the
Pre-Raphaelites had then in view must be surely
deemed unconvincing in the presence of his
great picture entitled &#8220;Work,&#8221; wherein an
unflinching reliance upon nature is the dominant
characteristic. Frederick Sandys, here admirably
represented by the portrait of Mrs. Clabburn
and by &#8220;Medea,&#8221; showed even more conclusively
in his varied work in design his right to be
reckoned side by side with the leaders I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
named; while Burne-Jones, who always generously
acknowledged his indebtedness to Rossetti,
displayed as his powers developed a kindred
attachment to the kind of beauty in painting
which finds its well-spring in the art of Florence.
The water-colours in the present collection
represent him at a time when Rossetti&#8217;s example
and influence were still dominant, but &#8220;Love
among the Ruins,&#8221; lent by Mrs. Michie, and
&#8220;The Mirror of Venus,&#8221; from the collection of
Mr. Goldman, reveal to us the painter in the
plenitude of his powers, when with full mastery
of resource he revelled in the interpretation of
themes of imaginative significance. A great
colourist in the sense in which the Florentines
use colour&mdash;a great designer, gifted from the
outset with the power of striking into symbol
forms of beauty that might equally serve to fire
the fancy of a poet, Burne-Jones holds a unique
position in our school; nor are his claims to
admiration likely to suffer from the fact that
the principles he professed have sometimes been
adopted by imitators not sufficiently endowed
for so high an endeavour.</p>

<p>In the story of a movement that limitations
of space must needs leave inadequate it would be
impossible to ignore or to omit the names of
two men who worthily occupied a distinguished
place in the art of their time. G. F. Watts and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
Lord Leighton may both be said to stand apart
from the particular current of artistic revolution
associated with the names I have already cited.
The former was already deeply imbued with the
spirit of the great Venetians even before the Pre-Raphaelite
Brotherhood had come into being,
but the poetic impulse, which he owned in
common with his younger contemporaries, sets
much of his work in clear alliance with theirs.
His &#8220;Love and Death&#8221; illustrates in a form of
unquestioned beauty the attempt to combine the
sometimes divergent qualities of the two great
schools of Italy; and the example set by both
reappears in a union that is entirely satisfying
when Watts turns to the task of portraiture.
Nor could any better examples of his accomplishment
have been procured than the figure of Lord
Tennyson or the head of Mr. Walter Crane.</p>

<p>Lord Leighton&#8217;s finely cultivated talent,
though his early sojourn at Florence had coloured
the work of his youth, reveals at the hour of its
maturity an undivided allegiance to classic ideals.
His mediaevalism was a garb quickly discarded.
&#8220;By degrees,&#8221; he once wrote to me, &#8220;my
growing love for form made me intolerant of
the restraints and exigencies of costume and led
me more and more, and finally, to a class of
subjects, or more accurately to a state of conditions,
in which supreme scope is left to pure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
artistic qualities, in which no form is imposed
upon the artist by the tailor, but in which every
form is made obedient to the conception of the
design he has in hand. These conditions classic
subjects afford, and as vehicles therefore of
abstract form, which is a thing not of one time
but of all time, these subjects can never be
obsolete, and though to many they are a dead
letter, they can never be an anachronism.&#8221;
With this confession of faith before us we may
measure how far the unceasing labours of a long
career availed to satisfy the noble purpose of his
youth. A certain lack of virility, an imperfect
sense of energy and movement which is needed
to give the final sense of vitality to all art,
however directed, may perhaps be alleged even
against the most complete of his achievements;
but the saving sense of grace, revealed in forms
often finely proportioned and justly selected,
remains as an abiding element in his constant
pursuit of classic perfection, and is clearly enough
illustrated in such works as the &#8220;Summer Moon&#8221;
and the &#8220;Return of Persephone,&#8221; which the committee
have secured for the present exhibition.</p>

<p>We must return now for a while to the earlier
experiments of our school in order to trace the
growth of the art of landscape, a department
wherein by the consent of Europe our painters
hold a place of indisputable supremacy. Gainsborough,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
as I have already hinted, had found in
the surroundings of his Suffolk home the material
he needed for the display of his deeply seated
love of outward nature; and his achievements in
this kind rest as the first foundation of what is
most enduringly characteristic in English landscape
painting. But as early as the year 1749,
when Gainsborough was only a youth of twenty-two,
Richard Wilson was already resident in
Italy, and had begun that exquisite series of
studies from Italian scenery which won so small
a meed of praise from his own generation. The
special direction of his art was not, indeed, destined
to inspire many of those who came after him, for
the new spirit of naturalism sought and captured
certain qualities of dramatic expressions in the
rendering of nature that were not of his seeking;
nor was the ordered beauty of his compositions,
or the serene charm which characterises his gift
as a colourist, likely to be heeded by a race of
painters who were already on the alert to seize
and record those fleeting effects of changing light
and tone which found such splendid embodiment
in the vigorous painting of Constable. Constable&#8217;s
frank reliance upon light and shade as constituting
the final element of beauty in landscape could
never have been accepted without reserve by
Richard Wilson, but the pursuit which Constable
initiated has owned an overpowering attraction for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
nearly all students of nature since his time; and
his example, transported to France through the art
of Michel, may be allowed to have powerfully
inspired that distinguished group of French
artists whose work was a part of the outcome
of the modern romantic movement. It would
be impossible here to distinguish in detail the
separate work of English painters who have
worthily carried forward the tradition established
by Constable; nor is it needful now to vindicate
the claims of men like Cotman, Cox, and Crome
in an earlier time, or of Hook and Cecil Lawson,
Sam Bough, Mason, and Frederick Walker,
whose more recent work brings the story of this
branch of art down to our own day. Of English
landscapists, indeed, the name is legion, and at
the head of them all, if we may judge by the
extent of the fame he has won, stands the name
of Joseph Mallord William Turner, whose genius,
heralded to the world by the eloquent advocacy
of Ruskin, is here fully illustrated in superb
examples from the collections of Mr. Chapman,
Lord Strathcona, Mr. Beecham, and Mr. Pierpont
Morgan. Turner, in his youth, while he was
still under the influence of Girtin, might well
have owned kinship with Richard Wilson, as
both in turn might have confessed their indebtedness
to the great Frenchman, Claude
Lorraine; but Turner&#8217;s talent, as it passed onward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
in steady development, parted completely
with the shackles imposed by earlier authority
and left him at the close of a brilliant career in
a position of complete isolation and independence.
There will always be those&mdash;and I may count
myself among the number&mdash;who will turn with
increasing love to the more restrained beauty of
his earlier work, and who will seek rather in his
water-colours than in his paintings in oil for the
finer expression of those more individual qualities
which marked the practice of his prime. But
personal preference need count for little in the
acknowledgment which all alike must freely
render, that his genius has conferred a lasting
glory upon the English school.</p>

<p>With this brief survey of the work of deceased
British artists the mission of the critic may here
fitly end. The purpose of such an introduction
as I have attempted is sufficiently served if, in
sketching the growth of our school from its
foundation in the middle of the eighteenth
century, I have succeeded in indicating the
several diverse currents which have contributed
to its development, and have left so rich a heritage
in achievement and example to the men of a
younger day. Of the varied quality of that later
work the exhibition must be left to speak for
itself. That the product of our time lacks
nothing of vitality is sufficiently shown in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
spirit of restless and untiring experiment which
marks the varied output of our younger school;
and that it still preserves among many of its
exponents a loyal adherence to the imperishable
traditions of the past is no less clearly asserted in
the work of men who are now labouring with
undiminished faith in the ideals established by
an earlier generation. Of Subject and Portrait,
in the art that leans for its support upon qualities
of decorative design and in the direct and searching
questionings of nature, noticeable in every
direction and manifest specially in the treatment
of landscape, there is a rich and abundant harvest
in the present collection.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">WITH GEORGE MEREDITH ON
BOX HILL</h2>
</div>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Come</span> down,&#8221; he wrote to me one day, &#8220;and
see our Indian summer here. A dozen differently
coloured torches you will find held up in our
woods, for which, however, as well as for your
sensitive skin, we require stillness and a smiling
or sober sky.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was written in the autumn of 1878, and
is drawn from one of many little notes of invitation
which used to preface a delightful day with
George Meredith on the slopes of Box Hill. Our
long rambles filled the afternoon, and were preceded
by a simple but thoughtfully chosen lunch,
which, when the weather allowed, was set out
upon a gravel walk in front of the cottage beside
the tall, sheltering hedge that gave shade from
the sun. Meredith attached no small importance
to the details of these little feasts. He
prided himself not a little on his gastronomic
knowledge, and was pleased when our climate
made it possible to reproduce the impression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
of a genuine French <i>d&eacute;jeuner en plein air</i>. In
another letter he writes: &#8220;The promise of
weather is good. Lilac, laburnum, nightingales,
and asparagus are your dishes. Hochheimer or
dry, still, red Bouzy, Richebourg and your friend
to wash all down.&#8221; His knowledge of these
matters of the table was, perhaps, not very profound,
but the appropriate vocabulary which gave
the air of the expert was always at his command.
And this, I think, was characteristic of the man
in respect of many fields of knowledge that lay
beyond the arena in which his imaginative powers
were directly engaged.</p>

<p>In his art he was never quite content to image
only the permanent facts of life, either in their
larger or simpler issues, unless he was permitted
at the same time to entangle the characters of
his creation in the coils of some problem that
was intellectual rather than purely emotional.
He loved to submit his creations to the instant
pressure of their time, and with this purpose it
was his business, no less than his pleasure, to
equip himself intellectually with garnered stores
of knowledge in fields into which the ordinary
writers of fiction rarely enter. It was not,
of course, to be supposed that he could claim
equal mastery in all, although his intellect
was so active and so agile that his limitations
were not easily discerned. I remember one day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
at an Exhibition in the New Gallery having
introduced him to an old gentleman, whose
long life had been spent in a study of the
drawings of the old masters, to whom Meredith,
with inimitable fluency, was expounding the
peculiar virtues of the art of Canaletto. Meredith
was eloquent, but the discourse somehow failed
to impress the aged student. When they had
parted his sole commentary to me was: &#8220;Your
friend&mdash;Mr. Meredith, I think you said&mdash;endeavoured
to persuade me that he understood
Canaletto, but he did not.&#8221;</p>

<p>But even if, in this single instance, the criticism
be accepted as just, it must be conceded by
all who knew him well that Meredith was not
often caught tripping in the discussion of any
topic in which his intellect had been actively
engaged. Sometimes&mdash;and then, perhaps, rather
in a spirit of audacious adventure and for exercise
of his incomparable powers of expression&mdash;he
would make a bold sortie into realms of knowledge
that were only half conquered. But this
was, for the most part, only when he had an
audience waiting on his words. When he had
only a single companion to listen there was no man
whose talk was more penetrating or more sincere:
and he was at his best, I used to think, in those
long rambles that filled our afternoons at Box Hill.
The active exercise in which he delighted seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
to steady and concentrate those intellectual forces
that sometimes ran riot when he felt himself
called upon to dominate the mixed assembly of
a dinner table.</p>

<p>No one, assuredly, ever possessed a more genuine
or a more exalted delight in nature. His veneration
for the earth and for all that sprang from the
earth as an unfailing and irrefutable source of the
highest sanity in thought and feeling, amounted
almost to worship. He never deliberately set
out to paint the landscape in set language as we
passed along, but a brief word dropped here and
there upon our way, telling of some aspect of
beauty newly observed and newly registered,
showed clearly that every fresh encounter with
nature served to add another gem to the hoarded
store of beauty that lay resident in his mind.
And yet, even here, the research for the recondite,
either in the fact observed or in the phrase that
fixed it, peeped out characteristically in the most
careless fashion of his talk. He loved to signalise
an old and abiding love of the outward world by
some new token that found expression at once in
language newly coined; and he would break
away on a sudden from some long-drawn legend
of a half-imaginary character that was often set
in the frame of burlesque, to note, with a swift
change to a graver tone, some passing aspect of
the scene that challenged his admiration afresh.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
And then, when he had quietly added this last
specimen to his cabinet, he would as quickly
turn again, with boisterous mirth, to complete
the caricature portrait of some common friend,
which he loved to embellish with every detail
of imagined embroidery.</p>

<p>In a mixed company Meredith did not often
lean to the discussion of literature. He inclined
rather, if an expert on any subject was present,
to press the conversation in that direction, exhibiting
nearly always a surprising knowledge
of the specialist&#8217;s theme, knowledge at any rate
sufficient to yield in the result a full revelation
of the store of information at the disposal of
his interlocutor. But in those long rambles
when we were alone he loved to consider and
discuss the claims of the professors of his own art,
rejecting scornfully enough the current standards
of his own time, but approaching with entire
humility the work of masters whom he acknowledged.
In those days (I am speaking now of
the years between 1875 and 1888) he had
by no means attained even to that measure of
popularity which came to him at a later time,
and when the talk veered towards his own work
it was easy to perceive a lurking sense of disappointment
that left him, however, with an
undiminished faith in the art to which his life
was pledged.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>During the autumn of 1878 I had written to
him in warm appreciation of some of his poems,
and his reply is characteristic. &#8220;There is no
man,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;I would so strongly wish to
please with my verse. I wish I had more time
for it, but my Pactolus, a shrivelled stream at
best, will not flow to piping, and as to publishing
books of verse, I have paid heavily for that
audacity twice in pounds sterling. I had for
audience the bull, the donkey, and the barking
cur. He that pays to come before them a third
time, we will not give him his name.&#8221; I think
in regard to all his work, whether in prose or
verse, he was haunted at that time by the
presence of the bull, the donkey, and the barking
cur. But if this had yielded for the moment
some sense of bitterness in regard to the results
of his own career, his attitude towards life was
even then undaunted, and left him generously disposed
towards all achievement of true pretensions,
either in the present or in the past. Indeed,
the true greatness of the man was in nothing
better displayed than in the unbroken urbanity
of his outlook upon life. His was of all natures
I have known the most hopeful of the world&#8217;s
destiny. The starved and shrivelled pessimism
of the disappointed egotist had no part in his
disposition. His wider outlook upon life was
undimmed by the pain of whatever measure of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
personal failure had befallen him, and I believe

itself been sufficing and complete, he could have
drawn from the earth, and the unfading beauty
of the earth, encouragement enough to keep him
steadfast in his way.</p>

full comradeship with nature in the opening

<p>In his prose work Meredith seems often half
distrustful of his own inspiration, halting now
and then to test the validity of the emotions he
has awakened, and at times letting a jet of irony
on to the fire he has kindled, as though half
suspicious that he had been lured into the ways
of the sentimentalist. But in his poetry he owns
a larger daring and a higher freedom; there he
treads unhampered by these half-conscious fears,
and yet there, no less than in his prose, we can
recognise his insatiable hunger to find and discover
new tokens by which to arrest the vision
that he loves.</p>

<p>Meredith&#8217;s little cottage at the foot of Box
Hill was the fittest home for the writer and for
the man. Not so far removed from town as to
be beyond the echo of its strife, it enabled him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
when his duty as reader to Chapman and Hall
took him to the office to pass an hour or two at
luncheon at the Garrick Club, where he loved
in these brief intervals of leisure to rally some of
his old friends in laughing and cheerful converse.</p>

<p>These occasional visits served to keep him in
touch with the moving problems of his time,
towards none of which he affected any kind of
indifference; and yet the pungent wit and
profound penetration of view with which he
handled such mundane themes were won and
hoarded, I think, in the long silences and the
chosen loneliness of his Surrey home. Hard by
Flint Cottage stands the little inn at Burford
Bridge, now transformed and enlarged to meet
the constant incursions of visitors from the town,
but at the time when I first remember it but
little changed from the days when it sheltered
Keats while he was setting the finishing touches
to &#8220;Endymion.&#8221; The association often led us
in our rambles to speak of the work of the
earlier poet, for whose faultless art Meredith
owned an unbounded admiration. Of the poets
I think he spoke more willingly than of the
writers of prose, though he was on the alert to
recognise genius in any form, and never lacked
enthusiasm in appraising the work of a writer
like Charlotte Bront&euml;. For George Eliot&#8217;s
achievement he never professed more than a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
strictly limited respect. Her more pretentious
literary methods failed to impress him, and there
were times when the keenness of his hostile
criticism bordered upon scorn. I remember
when some one in his presence ventured to
remark that George Eliot, &#8220;panoplied in all the
philosophies, was apt to swoop upon a commonplace,&#8221;
he hailed the criticism with the keenest
enjoyment, and half-laughingly declared that he
would like to have forged the phrase himself.</p>

<p>At the close of our afternoon rambles, that
in summer time were prolonged to close upon
the dinner-hour, we would return at loitering
pace down the winding paths to the cottage, and
when I was able to stay the night our evenings
would be spent in the little ch&acirc;let that stood on the
hill at the summit of his garden. Meredith truly
loved the secluded bower that he had fashioned
for himself. It was there he worked, and during
the summer months it was there he constantly
passed the night. It was there I used to leave
him when our long talk was over, and descend
the garden to the room that had been allotted to
me in the cottage. But of talk he never tired,
and it was often far into the night before we
parted. He loved also, when he found an
appreciative listener, to read aloud long passages
from his poems. Once I remember he recited
to me during a single evening the whole of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
body of sonnets forming the poem of &#8220;Modern
Love.&#8221; On occasion&mdash;but not, perhaps, quite so
willingly&mdash;he might be tempted to anticipate
publication by reading a chapter or two from an
uncompleted story, and I can recall with what
admirable effect, not at Box Hill, but at Ightham
Moat where we were both the guests of a
gracious hostess, whose death long preceded his
own, he read aloud to us the remarkable opening
chapters of the &#8220;Amazing Marriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meredith greatly enjoyed those occasional
visits to his friends, and found himself, I think,
especially at home in the house I have named.
He did not disdain the little acts of homage there
freely offered him, for the guests assembled were
always to be counted among his worshippers, and
yet he was finely free from the smallest pretence
of consciously asserted dignity. As a rule, he
spoke but little of his own work, and then only
on urgent invitation, content, for the most part,
to accept the passing topic, which his high spirits
and unflagging humour would quickly lift to
illumination. On such occasions he loved to
invent and elaborate, for one or other of his more
intimate friends, some fancied legend that was
absolutely detached from life and reality, and
sometimes he so fell in love with the fable of
his creation that for weeks or months afterwards
his letters would continue to elaborate and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
develop a story that had only taken birth in the
jesting mood of a moment.</p>

<p>The young people of a country-house always
found a welcome from Meredith, and towards
women at all times his respect was of a kind that
needed no spur of social convention. It sprang
of a deep faith in their high service to the world,
and a quickened belief in the larger future that
was in store for them. In his own home the
spirit of raillery, that he could not always curb,
sometimes pressed too hardly upon those nearest
him; but I think he was scarcely conscious of
any pain he may have inflicted&mdash;hardly aware,
indeed, of the reiterated insistence with which
he would sometimes expose and ridicule some
harmless foible of character that did not deserve
rebuke. But if this fault must be conceded in
regard to those who stood in the intimate circle
of his home, it certainly implied no failing
reverence towards the sex they owned. After
all, an artist, who has a full claim to that title,
is revealed most truly in his work. If the
revelation there can be suspected, the art is false,
and it may, I think, be claimed without challenge
for Meredith that in the created characters of his
work he has done for women what has been
accomplished by no other writer since Shakespeare.
Over all the mystery that gives them
charm, his mastery in delineation was complete,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
but it is his appreciation of the nobler possibilities
of character that lie behind the wayward changes
of temperament that sets his portraiture of women
beyond the reach of rivalry. I think most
women who came to know him were conscious
of this in his presence, and it is small wonder
that that larger circle who met themselves
mirrored in his books should count him among
the most fearless champions of their sex.</p>

<p>A few months ago I found myself treading
once more the road that leads to his cottage
under the hill. Once again a &#8220;dozen differently
coloured torches&#8221; were held up in the woods
behind the house, flaming as I saw them first
in his company. But there was one torch that
burned no more. It had fallen from the hand
that held it, and lay extinguished upon the earth
his spirit owned and loved. But those days I
passed with him there are memorable still, and as
I stood beside the cottage gate amid the gathering
shadows of evening, his own beautiful lines
came back to me from &#8220;Love in the Valley&#8221;:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Lovely are the curves of the white owl sweeping</div>
<div class="indent">Wavy in the dusk lit by one large star.</div>
<div class="verse">Lone on the fir-branch, his rattle-note unvaried,</div>
<div class="indent">Brooding o&#8217;er the gloom, spins the brown eve-jar.</div>
<div class="verse">Darker grows the valley, more and more forgetting:</div>
<div class="indent">So were it with me if forgetting could be willed.</div>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE LEGEND OF PARSIFAL</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> few years ago, when I was writing my
play of <i>Tristram and Iseult</i>, a lady of my acquaintance,
who was familiar with the music-drama
by Wagner on the same theme, asked me by
what means I had contrived to secure Madame
Wagner&#8217;s consent to the use of the story for the
English stage. Such ignorance of one of the
most beautiful of the legends included in the
Arthurian cycle, enshrined for English readers
by Sir Thomas Malory&#8217;s immortal prose romance
of <i>Le Morte d&#8217;Arthur</i>, is of course phenomenal
and extreme, but it was matched by my experience
a few days after the production of the
play, when an enterprising newscutting agency,
misled by some reference in the programme to
the great chronicler, forwarded to the theatre
a bundle of criticisms addressed to Sir Thomas
Malory, Knight, oblivious of the fact that he
had passed beyond the reach of censure in the
closing years of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>It is possible, however, that even among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
some of those to whom the source of the Tristram
story is familiar, there may be here and there
isolated worshippers of the great German composer
who are hardly aware that the legend of
Parsifal found its source in the same great body
of Arthurian romance. Indeed, I have met
with not a few to whom the identification of
Parsifal with the British hero, Sir Perceval,
comes somewhat as a surprise, and who are
scarcely conscious that the whole legend of the
&#8220;Holy Grail,&#8221; which forms the subject of
Wagner&#8217;s opera, had its source in Britain, and
was afterwards incorporated in romances that
first saw the light in France. The writer who
originally gave to the story its poetic form, and
in whose work the purely human features of the
narrative are already linked with the history of
Christianity, was Crestien de Troyes, who began
to write about 1150, and died before the end
of the twelfth century. His poems embrace a
number of the Arthurian stories, but it so
happens that amongst them the &#8220;Conte del
Graal&#8221; was left unfinished, and was afterwards
completed by several writers, chief among whom,
Wauchier, confessed that he had drawn his
inspiration from the work of a Welshman,
Bleheris, in whose version the &#8220;Grail&#8221; hero
is not Sir Perceval but Sir Gawain.</p>

<p>But even before Crestien&#8217;s death the beauty of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
certain of these Arthurian legends had captured the
imagination of Europe, and in the opening years
of the thirteenth century we have the &#8220;Parzival&#8221;
of Wolfram von Eschenbach, of Bavaria, who
admits his knowledge of Crestien, but confesses
a preference for a still older French version by
Guyot, the Proven&ccedil;al. To Wolfram&#8217;s poem
Wagner is directly indebted for that portion of
the story which forms the basis of the opera.
The Bavarian knight died about the year 1220,
and his work forms a complete and beautiful poem,
concluding with a recital of the fortunes of
Lohengrin, the son of Parsifal, who, in his turn,
became ruler of the Grail Kingdom. Here, as
with Crestien, the link with Christianity is firmly
established, and in a still later form of the story
embodied by Malory the Christianising influence
is further developed, and the Grail, now definitely
identified with the Holy Cup, is assumed to have
been brought to Britain by Joseph of Arimathea,
who himself had filled it with the blood that
flowed from the side of the Redeemer.</p>

<p>In all these later forms of the legend, however,
certain features and incidents survive which
clearly prove that the story owned an earlier,
and a Pagan source. Even in Wolfram the
Grail is not a cup, but a stone endowed with
plenty-giving qualities, and the symbols, which
in all later versions are bodily taken over for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
service of the Church, we find on examination
to possess a pre-Christian character and origin.</p>

<p>A subject upon which such a mass of criticism
and scholarship has accumulated cannot here be
discussed in full, but the learned work of the
late Alfred Nutt, and the acute researches into
the heart of the mystery made by Miss Jessie
Weston, one of the most patient and diligent
students of a difficult problem, establish almost
beyond dispute that the Grail, in its earlier
manifestations, bore no relation to the history
of the Christian faith. The magic symbols that
stood ready to the hand of those who gave to
the legend its final religious shape had indisputably
an earlier and a different significance. The
dripping lance, that now becomes the weapon
that pierced the Body of the Redeemer; the
Cup containing the blood that flowed from His
Side, had figured first as life-giving symbols
before they had taken on the holier character
with which they are endowed by the chroniclers
of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.</p>

<p>This was well established by Mr. Alfred
Nutt, who referred their origin to the earlier
forms of Celtic folklore; and in Miss Jessie
Weston&#8217;s latest contribution to the literature of
the subject, published in June of the present
year, a powerful plea is put forward for the
interpretation of the story in the light of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
earlier forms of nature-worship, linked by far-reaching
tradition with the ritual of the Adonis
cult, and associated with the quest for the
principle of Life itself. It is unquestionably
true that this theory explains as no other can
many of the features of the Grail story which
have no relation to Christianity. The Fisher
King, the Guardian of the precious Grail, is a
title which cannot be understood unless we take
account of primitive tradition, in which the fish
is widely employed as a symbol of life, and the
fate and character of the maimed king who
guards the Grail, as well as the mystic instruments
which accompany its revelation, are equally
referable to Pagan ritual belonging to earlier
forms of nature-worship.</p>

<p>This is not the place to follow in detail the
many intricate and puzzling problems which
beset the history of the Grail. It is, indeed,
a fascinating theme, and has already attracted
the learning and research of many scholars in
England, Germany, and France, and is perhaps
destined, in the absence of some of the earlier
texts from which the legend was drawn, never
to receive a final and wholly satisfying solution.
Here, however, we are concerned only with those
features of the story at a date when it had
already received the stamp of Christian sentiment,
and more especially with that particular form of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
it embodied by the composer, Richard Wagner,
in his world-famous opera.</p>

<p>Apart from the hero himself, the characters
engaged in the drama are not numerous. There
is the aged Titurel; the wounded Amfortas
whose sufferings, imposed as the penalty of unlawful
love, must endure till the coming of the
deliverer, Parsifal; Klingsor, the malign ruler of
the enchanted castle, served by the spell-bound
Kundry, an enchantress, only to be released
from her thraldom by the knight who successfully
resists her witch-like fascinations; and
Gurnemanz, through whose aid and guidance
the hero is finally enabled to accomplish his
task. All appear in Wolfram&#8217;s romance, under
the names retained by Wagner; and the types
recur also in other versions of the legend, sometimes
under different names, and with endless
variations in the adventures befalling them.
Parsifal is our own Sir Perceval, a knight of
Arthur&#8217;s Court, the Peredur of the Mabinogion,
not, however, the earliest or the latest hero of
the Grail quest. Before him in historic position
is Sir Gawain, who, as already noted, plays the
r&ocirc;le of deliverer in the poem of Bleheris; while
in the later romances his place is taken by the
chaste Sir Galahad, the son of Sir Lancelot, who&mdash;by
reason of his sin with Guinevere&mdash;was
denied the reward of achieving the quest in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
own person. In like manner the Grail King,
Amfortas, takes on other titles, according to the
particular source of the legend, while the part
played by Kundry as the Grail messenger is only
a variant of the r&ocirc;le assigned to the &#8220;Loathly
Damsel,&#8221; with the added qualities of the
sorceress, who serves the sinister purpose of
Klingsor in the enchanted castle.</p>

<p>But a comparison of all these legends leaves
undisturbed the fact that in its original shape
the story and its environment are British, and,
further, that it first took literary form in the
work of a Welsh poet. Issuing thence, as we
now know, this and other of the Arthurian
romances spread like a flame over the Western
world, finding their principal exponents in
Germany and France, but extending even to
Sicily, where there is still a tradition that in the
mirage that floats between the island and the
mainland can be seen the sleeping form of
King Arthur embedded in the heart of Etna,
and awaiting the sound of the horn that shall
summon him back to his kingdom. It is not a
little strange that these legends, doomed to the
long sleep of King Arthur himself, should have
awakened to new vitality in the work of our own
modern poets, and should equally have attracted
the genius of the great German composer.</p>

<p>To those who are interested in the dramatic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
side of Wagner&#8217;s genius, the study of Wolfram&#8217;s
beautiful poem, to which he is directly indebted,
will not be without fruitful results. As
a general comment, it may be said that the
dramatist misses something of the spirit of
romance, something also of the atmosphere of
chivalry to be found in the master whom he has
followed. On the other hand, it will be clearly
seen that he had handled this material with the
vision of a dramatist, supported by an imagination
which seizes, instinctively and surely, upon
personages and incidents that enforce the ethical
message he seeks to deliver. Perhaps the most
beautiful part of Wolfram&#8217;s poem, of necessity
excluded from the closer action of drama, concerns
Parsifal&#8217;s earlier years, before he had won
the right to carry arms as one of the knights of
King Arthur&#8217;s Court. Gahmuret, his father, in
search of adventure, had first taken service under
Baruc, and had won the love of the heathen
queen, Belakane, who bore him a son, Feirefiz,
the father of Prester John. But before the
birth of the child, Gahmuret, returning to
Europe, had sought and won the love of Queen
Herzeleide, the mother of the Grail hero.
Gahmuret was manifestly very conscious of
his restless temperament, and duly warned his
newly-won bride that what had happened before
might recur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Then he looked on Queen Herzeleide, and he spake to her courteously:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;If in joy we would live, O Lady, then my warder thou shalt not be,</div>
<div class="verse">When loosed from the bonds of sorrow, for knighthood my heart is fain;</div>
<div class="verse">If thou holdest me back from Tourney I may practise such wiles again</div>
<div class="verse">As of old, when I fled from the lady whom I won with mine own right hand,</div>
<div class="verse">When from strife she would fain have kept me, I fled from her folk and land.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Then she spake: &#8220;Set what bonds thou willest, by thy word I will still abide.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Many spears would I break asunder and each month would to Tourney ride,</div>
<div class="verse">Thou shalt murmur not, O Lady, when such knightly joust I&#8217;ld run!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">This she sware, so the tale was told me, and the maid and her lands he won.</div>
</div></div>

<p>And yet, despite her brave front, Herzeleide
was destined to endure much sorrow at the
hands of her restless lord. Before Parsifal was
born, he had already set out on fresh adventure,
leaving his lonely lady sick with longing for his
return.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">As for half a year he was absent, she looked for his coming sure,</div>
<div class="verse">For but in the thought of that meeting might the life of the Queen endure.</div>
<div class="verse">Then brake the sword of her gladness thro&#8217; the midst of the hilt in twain,</div>
<div class="verse">Ah, me, and alas! for her mourning, that goodness should bear such pain</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
<div class="verse">And faith ever waken sorrow! Yea, so doth it run alway</div>
<div class="verse">With the life of men, and to-morrow must they mourn who rejoice to-day!</div>
</div></div>

<p>Here follow the bitter tidings of Gahmuret&#8217;s
death. Then, when the child of sorrow came to
be born, Herzeleide retreated from the Court,
and took refuge in a wild woodland, where
Parsifal grew to manhood, in ignorance of the
world and its ways; in ignorance also of his high
lineage, for the Queen held that she had suffered
enough through knighthood and its adventures,
and sought only to rescue her child from the
dangers of his father&#8217;s fate. I am drawing again
upon Miss Jessie Weston&#8217;s charming translation
of Wolfram&#8217;s poem for this delightful picture of
Parsifal&#8217;s boyhood:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">No knightly weapon she gave him save such as in childish play</div>
<div class="verse">He wrought himself from the bushes that grew on his lonely way.</div>
<div class="verse">A bow and arrows he made him, and with these in thoughtless glee,</div>
<div class="verse">He shot at the birds as they carolled o&#8217;erhead in the leafy tree.</div>
<div class="verse">But when the feathered songster of the woods at his feet lay dead,</div>
<div class="verse">In wonder and dumb amazement he bowed down his golden head,</div>
<div class="verse">And in childish wrath and sorrow tore the locks of his sunny hair</div>
<div class="verse">(For I wot well of all earth&#8217;s children was never a child so fair</div>
<div class="verse">As this boy, who, afar in the desert, from the haunts of mankind did dwell,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
<div class="verse">Who bathed in the mountain streamlet, and roamed o&#8217;er the rock-strewn fell!)</div>
<div class="verse">Then he thought him well how the music which his hand had for ever stilled,</div>
<div class="verse">Had thrilled his soul with its sweetness; and his heart was with sorrow filled,</div>
<div class="verse">And the ready tears of childhood flowed forth from their fountains free,</div>
<div class="verse">And he ran to his mother weeping, and bowed him beside her knee.</div>
</div></div>

<p>It may be that this passage partly inspired
Wagner in his treatment of the incident of the
stricken swan; but in the heart of Herzeleide,
Parsifal&#8217;s love of the birds only begot a fierce
jealousy, and she sent forth her servants to snare
and slay the woodland choristers, so that she
might have no rival in her boy&#8217;s love. But the
boy&#8217;s reproaches touched the mother&#8217;s heart:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">... &#8220;Now sweet, my mother, why trouble the birds so sore,</div>
<div class="verse">Forsooth they can ne&#8217;er have harmed thee, ah! leave them in peace once more!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">And his mother kissed him gently, &#8220;Perchance I have wrought a wrong,</div>
<div class="verse">Of a truth the dear God who made them, He gave unto them their song,</div>
<div class="verse">And I would not that one of His creatures should sorrow because of me.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>The turning-point in Parsifal&#8217;s career came a
little later on, when on his wondering eyes fell
the vision of certain of King Arthur&#8217;s knights
who passed through the forest:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">It chanced through a woodland thicket one morn as he took his way,</div>
<div class="verse">And brake from o&#8217;erhanging bushes full many a leafy spray,</div>
<div class="verse">That a pathway steep and winding rose sharply his track anear,</div>
<div class="verse">And the distant beat of horse-hoofs fell strange on his wondering ear.</div>
<div class="verse">Then the boy grasped his javelin firmly, and thought what the sound might be;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Perchance &#8217;tis the Devil cometh; well, I care not if it be he!</div>
<div class="verse">Methinks I can still withstand him, be he never so fierce and grim,</div>
<div class="verse">Of a truth my lady mother she is o&#8217;er much afraid of him!&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">As he stood there for combat ready, behold! in the morning light</div>
<div class="verse">Three knights rode into the clearing in glittering armour bright.</div>
<div class="verse">From head to foot were they arm&egrave;d, each one on his gallant steed,</div>
<div class="verse">And the lad, as he saw their glory, thought each one a god indeed!</div>
<div class="verse">No longer he stood defiant, but knelt low upon his knee,</div>
<div class="verse">And cried, &#8220;God who helpest all men, I pray Thee have thought for me!&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>From that hour the boy&#8217;s heart, like that of
his father, was fired by the spirit of adventure.
How he followed after them in their wanderings,
and how, after much happening, he arrived at
King Arthur&#8217;s Court, were too long to tell.
When she saw that his mind was made up his
mother put no obstacle in his path, but robed
him in the garb of a fool, thinking, in the
cunning of her mother heart, and &#8220;the cruelty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
of a mother&#8217;s love,&#8221; as the poet phrases it, that
when the world mocked him he would return
to the forest again.</p>

<p>It is at this point in the mental development
of our hero that he makes his entrance into
Wagner&#8217;s opera. As already noted, full and
skilful use is made by the modern author of the
dramatic material which the legend discloses.
In the associated characters of Kundry and
Klingsor he has given logical and coherent form
to much that lies scattered and disjointed in
Wolfram&#8217;s poem; and he has built up the
character of Parsifal, adding to the simpler
conception of the older writer an element of conscious
philosophy that makes a strong appeal to the
countrymen of Goethe. Not, be it said, that
the outline left by Wolfram was indefinite or
uncertain. Already in the legend Parsifal&#8217;s
personality is clearly marked. &#8220;A brave man,&#8221;
says Wolfram, &#8220;yet slowly wise is he whom I
hail my hero,&#8221; and the steady growth of wisdom
based on sympathy and suffering is clearly traced
in Parsifal&#8217;s successive visits to the Grail Castle.
It is the ignorance of innocence and egotism that
on the first occasion keeps his lips dumb, when
the sympathy he was afterwards to acquire might
have prompted the simple question that would
have set the sufferer free, while it was the richer
experience that came as his after inheritance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
which enabled him finally to achieve the liberation
of the wounded Amfortas. Of that first
visit of Parsifal to the Castle, Wolfram writes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Yet one, uncalled, rode thither, and evil did then befall,</div>
<div class="verse">For foolish he was, and witless, and sin-laden from thence did fare,</div>
<div class="verse">Since he asked not his host of his sorrow and the woe that he saw him bear.</div>
<div class="verse">No man would I blame, yet this man I ween for his sins must pay</div>
<div class="verse">Since he asked not the longed-for question which all sorrow had put away.</div>
</div></div>

<p>And in these lines we may find the germ
of Wagner&#8217;s more conscious and more didactic
conception, wherein we miss something of the
simplicity, something also of the rich humanity
of the twelfth-century poet. This sense of loss
in the modern presentment of the theme, loss in
the spirit of romance, and in the impression of
free and unfettered humanity, is perhaps an
individual impression; and I may conclude with
a tribute to Wagner&#8217;s genius by the late Alfred
Nutt, which certainly does ample justice to the
composer&#8217;s contribution to the story, as he
accepted it from the hands of the Bavarian
knight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kundry,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;is Wagner&#8217;s great
contribution to the legend. She is the Herodias
whom Christ, for her laughter, doomed to
wander till He come again. Subject to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
powers of evil, she must tempt and lure to their
destruction the Grail warriors. And yet she
would find release and salvation could a man
resist her witch-like spell. She knows this.
The scene between the unwilling temptress,
whose success would but doom her afresh, and
the virgin Parsifal thus becomes tragic in the
extreme. How does this affect Amfortas and
the Grail? In this way. Parsifal is a &#8216;pure
fool,&#8217; knowing naught of sin or suffering. It has
been foretold of him he should become &#8216;wise by
fellow-suffering,&#8217; and so it proves. The overmastering
rush of desire unseals his eyes, clears
his mind. Heart-wounded by the shaft of
passion, he feels Amfortas&#8217;s torture thrill through
him. The pain of the physical wound is his,
but far more the agony of the sinner who has
been unworthy of his high trust, and who, soiled
by carnal sin, must yet daily come in contact
with the Grail, symbol of the highest purity and
holiness. The strength which comes of the new-born
knowledge enables him to resist sensual
longing, and thereby to release both Kundry and
Amfortas.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SEX IN TRAGEDY</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the popular view of the play of <i>Macbeth</i> the
relation of the two principal characters may be
said to lie beyond the region of doubt or discussion.
According to the tradition of the stage,
supported in this instance by a respectable array
of critical authority, the motive-power of the
drama is not supplied by the &#8220;vaulting ambition&#8221;
of Macbeth himself, but is to be sought rather
in the sinister strength and inhuman cruelty of
his guilty partner. In virtue of her unshaken
resolution and her superior resource, Lady
Macbeth is regarded as the dominating influence
in this awful record of crime, and it may indeed
be doubted whether any part of equal length&mdash;for,
counted by actual lines, it is one of the
shortest in all tragic drama&mdash;has ever left so
strong a stamp on the popular imagination. Nor
is the prevalent conception of Lady Macbeth&#8217;s
character lacking at all in distinctness of definition.
The outlines of the portrait are sharply
and deeply impressed: and as she is commonly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
represented to us, it takes the form of a sexless
creature endowed with the temper of a man
and the heart of a fiend. The embodiment of
all those fiercer passions that are deemed to be
most repugnant to the ideal of womanhood, and
moved by a will that is deaf to the pleadings of
humanity and inaccessible to the voice of eternal
law, she is regarded as the evil genius of her
husband, crushing by the weight of her stronger
individuality the constant promptings of his
better nature, and sweeping him with irresistible
force into a bottomless abyss of crime.</p>

<p>To this popular view of the character Mrs.
Kemble, in her notes on Shakespeare, gives
vivacious expression. Here we are told that
Lady Macbeth was not only devoid of &#8220;all the
peculiar sensibilities of her sex,&#8221; but that she
was actually incapable of the feelings of remorse.
The sleepless madness of her closing hours was
not, so we are assured, the result of conscious
guilt, for that was foreign to her nature: it
resembled rather the nightmare of a butcher who
is haunted by the blood in which his hands are
imbrued. And as to her death, it was due in no
degree to the anguish of a stricken soul, but was
in some occult way directly traceable to the unconquerable
wickedness of her heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; writes Mrs. Kemble, with the
eager interest of a scientific inquirer on the track<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
of a new poison, &#8220;her life was destroyed by sin
as by a disease of which she was unconscious,
and that she died of a broken heart, while the
impenetrable resolution of her will remained
unbowed. The spirit was willing, but the flesh
was weak; the body can sin but so much and
survive; and other deadly passions besides those
of violence and sensuality can wear away its
fine tissues and undermine its wonderful fabric.
The woman&#8217;s mortal frame succumbed to the
tremendous weight of sin and suffering which
her immortal soul had power to sustain; and
having destroyed its temporal house of earthly
sojourn, that soul, unexhausted by its wickedness,
went forth into its new abode of eternity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Allowing for a certain feminine vehemence in
the wording of the indictment, this view of Lady
Macbeth can scarcely be said to exaggerate the
current conception of her character. That it
represents a somewhat grotesque caricature of
Shakespeare&#8217;s marvellous creation, will plainly
appear from even the most cursory examination
of the text, and has, indeed, already been
pointed out on more than one occasion. In
1867 Mr. P. W. Clayden, in the <i>Fortnightly
Review</i>, made a praiseworthy attempt to revive
the finer outlines of Shakespeare&#8217;s portrait, an
attempt in which he had already been forestalled
by Mr. Fletcher in the <i>Westminster Review</i> for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
1844, and by a writer in the <i>National Review</i>
for 1863.</p>

<p>The only reproach that can fairly be brought
against the last-named article, which for the
rest deserves to rank as a careful and searching
piece of criticism, is that it has too much the
tone of being delivered as a brief in the lady&#8217;s
favour. The advocacy of her cause, and the
consequent denunciation of the character of her
husband, are both in a style that seems rather to
blur the imaginative beauty of the picture as a
whole. We are made to feel that we are sitting
in a court of law rather than at a poet&#8217;s feet, and
we are sharply reminded of the somewhat inappropriate
arena into which the discussion has
drifted by the writer&#8217;s concluding assertion, that
Macbeth was &#8220;one of the worst villains&#8221; ever
drawn by Shakespeare. Charges of this sort
smack too strongly of the forensic method, and
have but little significance when applied to the
central figure of a great tragedy. If Macbeth
stood at the bar of the Old Bailey he would
undoubtedly be convicted of murder, and so, for
that matter, would his wife; but it is the poet&#8217;s
privilege to lift the record of crime into an ideal
atmosphere; and when, at the magic bidding of
genius, the closest secrets of the human heart
have been unlocked, and its inner workings laid
bare, such epithets as may be used to dismiss the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
record of a police case cease to be instructive, and
are scarcely even relevant to the wider issue that
has been raised. The character of Iago, with
whom Macbeth is compared, stands on different
ground. It was there no part of Shakespeare&#8217;s
task to lift the impenetrable mask of malice
which serves as the instrument of Othello&#8217;s destruction.
Iago is known to us only by his pitiless
delight in human torture, and by the sinister
cruelty of which he stands accused and convicted;
while in the case of Macbeth, despite his heavier
record of actual crime, the evil that he wrought
serves only as the stepping-stone by which we
are allowed to enter into the deeper recesses of
his soul.</p>

<p>But there is one point in the article to which
we have referred that has a profound interest
for the student of the drama. It is the writer&#8217;s
main contention that the source of the error he
seeks to correct is to be traced to what he terms
a distortion of the stage. The figure of Lady
Macbeth as now popularly accepted is represented
as the lineal descendant of the genius of Mrs.
Siddons. It was her incomparable art which
first gave to the character the particular stamp
it now bears, and chased from the popular
imagination the more delicate creation of the
poet&#8217;s brain. This charge carries with it, of
course, a splendid tribute to the artist&#8217;s powers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
and the experience of our own time proves that
it may not be altogether unfounded. It is not
so long ago since the glamour of Salvini&#8217;s genius,
with its superb gifts of voice and bearing and
its incomparable technical resource, succeeded in
effacing the Othello of Shakespeare, leaving us
in its stead a figure admirably effective for the
purposes of the stage, but sadly lacking in the
higher and finer elements with which the character
had been endowed by the author. And it may
be added that the witness of contemporaries
goes far to support this particular view of Mrs.
Siddons&#8217; performance of the part. The poet
Campbell testifies to the extraordinary impression
she created when he writes that &#8220;the
moment she seized the part she identified her
image with it in the minds of the living generation.&#8221;
Boaden, her earlier biographer, speaking
of her first entrance on the scene, says,
&#8220;The distinction of sex was only external; &#8216;her
spirits&#8217; informed their tenement with the apathy
of a demon&#8221;; and evidence to the same effect is
supplied by the interesting notes of Professor
Bell, first published some few years ago by
Professor Fleeming Jenkin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of Lady Macbeth,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;there is
not much in the play, but the wonderful genius
of Mrs. Siddons makes it the whole. She makes
it tell the whole story of the ambitious project,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
the disappointment, the remorse, the sickness
and despair of guilty ambition, the attainment
of whose object is no cure for the wounds of
the spirit. Macbeth in Kemble&#8217;s hand is only
a co-operating part. I can conceive Garrick to
have sunk Lady Macbeth as much as Mrs.
Siddons does Macbeth, yet when you see Mrs.
Siddons play the part you scarcely can believe
that any acting could make her part subordinate.
Her turbulent and inhuman strength of spirit
does all. She turns Macbeth to her purpose,
makes him her mere instrument, guides, directs,
and inspires the whole plot. Like Macbeth&#8217;s
evil genius, she hurries him on in the mad
career of ambition and cruelty from which his
nature would have shrunk.&#8221;</p>

<p>If this was really the impression produced
by Mrs. Siddons&mdash;and the Professor&#8217;s notes are
in close accord with Boaden&#8217;s description of her
as &#8220;an exulting savage&#8221;&mdash;it only proves how
potent a factor in the art of the stage is the
unconscious and inevitable intrusion of the actor&#8217;s
personality. For this creature of &#8220;turbulent
and inhuman strength of spirit&#8221; was not at all
what Mrs. Siddons in her critical moments
conceived Lady Macbeth to be. Her recorded
memoranda exhibit a widely different interpretation,
and contain, indeed, much penetrating
criticism on the general scope and purpose of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
the play. Even the physical image of Lady
Macbeth, as it presented itself to her imagination,
was strangely unlike the threatening and commanding
figure which she actually presented on
the stage. She thought of her as embodying
a type of beauty &#8220;generally allowed to be most
captivating to the other sex, fair, feminine, nay,
perhaps even fragile&#8221;&mdash;a description which calls
from her biographer the almost indignant protest
that &#8220;the public would ill have exchanged such
a representation for the dark locks and eagle eyes
of Mrs. Siddons.&#8221; But the most remarkable
feature of her criticism lies in its constant
insistence upon the essentially feminine nature
of Lady Macbeth. Speaking of her entrance
in the Third Act, she pictures in a few eloquent
words the sudden change which the haunting
memory of crime has already wrought in her
character. &#8220;The golden round of royalty now
crowns her brow and royal robes enfold her
form, but the peace which passeth all understanding
is lost to her for ever, and the worm
that never dies already gnaws her heart.&#8221; And,
again, still treating of this same scene, the
most deplorably pathetic in all tragedy, &#8220;she
exhibits for the first time striking indications of
sensibility, nay, tenderness and sympathy; and
I think this conduct is nobly followed up by
her during the whole of their subsequent eventful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
intercourse.&#8221; Not less striking is the keen
perception which these notes exhibit of the
terrible anguish of the woman herself: &#8220;Her
feminine nature, her delicate structure, it is too
evident, are soon overwhelmed by the enormous
pressure of her crimes.... She knows by her
own woeful experience the torments he undergoes,
and endeavours to alleviate his sufferings.&#8221;</p>

<p>But there is one sentence in these notes more
pregnant with meaning than all the rest. &#8220;The
different physical powers of the two sexes,&#8221; she
writes, &#8220;are finely delineated in the different
effects which their mutual crimes produce.&#8221;
Here in a few words is to be found the key
that will unlock the heart of the tragedy. Not
merely the different physical powers, but also,
and with even a deeper truth, the different
mental and moral characteristics of the two
sexes in the presence of crime, are here illustrated
by Shakespeare with unsurpassable force and
delicacy. This is the imaginative theme which
his transcendent genius has fastened upon the
legend of Macbeth, and there is scarcely a line
of the play which can be rightly understood
until we realise that the two central figures
are, and are deliberately intended to be, the
embodiment and expression of the contrasted
characteristics of sex. To argue that Lady
Macbeth is not truly and typically a woman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
is to destroy at one blow the delicate fabric
which the poet has been at such pains to
construct: to strive to vindicate the character
of her husband at her expense, is but a vain
endeavour to break through the empire of crime
which sways and dominates the lives of both.
There is here, indeed, no question of moral
rescue for either; and it were idle to debate
what he or she might have been under different
conditions. For, as Shakespeare has conceived
the action of the story, the shadow of guilt
hangs from the first like a murky cloud in the
sky, and the invisible hands of fate have drawn
the net of evil closely around them long ere they
appear upon the scene. But, accepting these conditions,
with the transformation of individual
character which they imply, <i>Macbeth</i> stands out
among the works of Shakespeare as a sublime
study of sexual contrast, a superb embodiment
of the force and the weakness of the conjugal
relation.</p>

<p>Coleridge has aptly observed that the dominant
note of the tragedy is struck in its opening lines.
The appearance of the supernatural agents of
evil serves to set the framework of the picture:
their choppy fingers have already drawn the
magic circle of malignant fate around the caged
souls of Macbeth and his partner, who are
henceforth to be prisoners in a world where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
&#8220;fog and filthy air&#8221; exclude the purer light of
heaven, a world in which the moral order of
the universe is upturned, and where &#8220;fair is
foul and foul is fair.&#8221; The whole after-action of
the story passes in this darkened and shadowed
light: the forms of the principal characters
starting out from a background of crime,
illumined as by the lurid gleam of a stormy
sunset whose clouds drip blood. And as the
play advances the scene seems gradually shifted
into some unknown latitude of eternal night,
where the voices of nature are made to chorus
the direful music of the witches&#8217; incantation.
Throughout the drama this dominant note of
evil is kept constantly vibrating. Even for
those whose hearts are free the poisoned air
seems to carry some taint of infection, and the
imagination shudders at the uneasy forebodings
that haunt the soul of Banquo, who fears to
trust his assured integrity to the attacks of the
secret agents of the dark.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Hold, take my sword.&mdash;There&#8217;s husbandry in heaven,</div>
<div class="verse">Their candles are all out.&mdash;Take thee that too.</div>
<div class="verse">A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,</div>
<div class="verse">And yet I would not sleep. Merciful powers!</div>
<div class="verse">Restrain in me the curs&egrave;d thoughts that nature</div>
<div class="verse">Gives way to in repose!</div>
</div></div>

<p><i>Macbeth</i>, indeed, in its imaginative setting is
a play of the night; and with unwearied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
imagery Shakespeare again and again appeals
to the forces of darkness as so many symbols
of the black pall of crime that weighs upon the
souls of Macbeth and his wife. Nearly every
page of the drama yields some striking picture
fit to conjure up such fears as Banquo feels.
Thus Macbeth himself on his way to the king&#8217;s
chamber:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse</div>
<div class="verse">The curtained sleep.</div>
</div></div>

<p>And, again, Lady Macbeth in the same
scene:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">It was the owl that shrieked, the fatal bellman</div>
<div class="verse">Which gives the stern&#8217;st good-night.</div>
</div></div>

<p>And when the murder has been committed,
Nature, through the lips of Lenox, makes her
own contribution to the picture:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The night has been unruly: where we lay,</div>
<div class="verse">Our chimneys were blown down; and, as they say,</div>
<div class="verse">Lamentings heard i&#8217; the air: strange screams of death</div>
<div class="verse">And, prophesying with accents terrible</div>
<div class="verse">Of dire combustion and confused events,</div>
<div class="verse">New hatched to the woful time, the obscure bird</div>
<div class="verse">Clamour&#8217;d the live-long night: some say the earth</div>
<div class="verse">Was feverous and did shake.</div>
</div></div>

<p>How superbly is the effect of this description
and its symbolic significance again enforced by
the words of Rosse in a subsequent scene:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent10">By the clock &#8217;tis day</div>
<div class="verse">And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp:</div>
<div class="verse">Is&#8217;t night&#8217;s predominance, or the day&#8217;s shame,</div>
<div class="verse">That darkness does the face of earth entomb,</div>
<div class="verse">When living light should kiss it?</div>
</div></div>

<p>The &#8220;night&#8217;s predominance&#8221; fit emblem of
the deeds of this &#8220;woful time&#8221; prevails to the
end: and as Macbeth advances in his terrible
crusade his soul becomes attuned to its surroundings,
and on the eve of Banquo&#8217;s murder he calls
darkness to his aid. &#8220;The west yet glimmers
with some streaks of day&#8221; when he utters that
terrible invocation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent12">Come, seeling night,</div>
<div class="verse">Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;</div>
<div class="verse">And, with thy bloody and invisible hand,</div>
<div class="verse">Cancel, and tear to pieces, that great bond</div>
<div class="verse">Which keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the crow</div>
<div class="verse">Makes wing to the rooky wood;</div>
<div class="verse">Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;</div>
<div class="verse">While night&#8217;s black agents to their prey do rouse.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Lady Macbeth had already anticipated the spirit
of this dread summons when, on the eve of
Duncan&#8217;s coming to her castle, she cries out in
the impatience of her passionate impulse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent10">Come, thick night,</div>
<div class="verse">And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell!</div>
<div class="verse">That my keen knife see not the wound it makes;</div>
<div class="verse">Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,</div>
<div class="verse">To cry &#8220;Hold, Hold!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>Through this realm of darkness, that knows
no dawn till that last hour when by the hand
of Macduff &#8220;the time is free,&#8221; Shakespeare
conducts his characters with no uncertain step.
Lit as by the light of the under-world, the fell
purpose of the guilty pair stands plainly revealed
to us on the very threshold of the drama: the
seeds of murder had been sown long ere the
weird sisters have shrieked their fatal preface to
the action; and before we meet with either
Macbeth or his wife, the souls of both are already
deeply dyed in blood. Nothing, indeed, could
be more absurd than to suggest that the murder
of Duncan is the fruit of sudden impulse on his
part or hers; nor could anything be more destructive
of the whole scheme of the poet&#8217;s work
than the assumption that Macbeth&#8217;s enfeebled
virtue was overborne by the satanic strength of
her will. We cannot too often remind ourselves
that there is no question of virtue here: it could
not live in the air they had learned to breathe:
it has passed beyond the ken of minds that have
long brooded over crime. And it may be
pointed out that Shakespeare himself has been at
particular pains to make this clear to us; for he
doubtless felt, and felt rightly, that unless the
starting-point were clearly kept in view, the
subsequent development of the action, with the
contrast of character it is designed to illustrate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
would lose all significance. Therefore at the first
entrance of Macbeth, when the eulogy of others
has but just pictured him to us as a soldier of
dauntless courage fighting loyally for his sovereign,
we are allowed to see that the thought of Duncan&#8217;s
death has already found a lodging in his heart.
As the weird sisters lift the veil of the future and
point the dark way to the throne, the vision that
presents itself to his eyes is but the mirrored
image of the bloody picture seated in his own
brain; and in foretelling the end, they wring
from his lips a confession of the means which he
has already devised for its fulfilment:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent">Why do I yield to that suggestion</div>
<div class="verse">Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair,</div>
<div class="verse">And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,</div>
<div class="verse">Against the use of nature? Present fears</div>
<div class="verse">Are less than horrible imaginings:</div>
<div class="verse">My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,</div>
<div class="verse">Shakes so my single state of man, that function</div>
<div class="verse">Is smothered in surmise; and nothing is</div>
<div class="verse">But what is not.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Then, like one affrighted by the echo of his
own voice, he stands for a moment appalled at
the concrete shape into which these withered
hags have thrown his own phantasy, and, seeking
to ignore, what he knows but too well, that
in this dread business fate and he are one, tries to
cheat his senses with the soothing anodyne that
he may yet escape the responsibilities of action:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me,</div>
<div class="verse">Without my stir.</div>
</div></div>

<p>But this mood lasts only a little while, for in the
next scene, even while his grateful sovereign is
loading him with honours, his dark purpose is
seen to have taken still more defined shape:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent9">Stars, hide your fires!</div>
<div class="verse">Let not light see my black and deep desires:</div>
<div class="verse">The eye wink at the hand! yet let that be,</div>
<div class="verse">Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.</div>
</div></div>

<p>All this, be it observed, takes place before the
meeting between himself and his wife. But it
needed not his coming to enable her to divine
his thoughts or to force her to confess her own.
His written message to her contains no hint of
murder, and yet the words she utters, as she
holds his letter in her hands, have no meaning
unless we suppose that the violent death of
Duncan had long been the subject of conjugal
debate. She has watched the working of the
poison in his breast, and has already anticipated
the hesitation which he afterwards displays.
How far her generous interpretation of his
halting action accords with the real character
of the man we shall presently see for ourselves:
but for the moment her speech suffices to afford
the clearest evidence that he had already imparted
to her his guilty purpose:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent9">Yet do I fear thy nature;</div>
<div class="verse">It is too full o&#8217; the milk of human kindness,</div>
<div class="verse">To catch the nearest way. Thou would&#8217;st be great;</div>
<div class="verse">Art not without ambition; but without</div>
<div class="verse">The illness should attend it. What thou would&#8217;st highly,</div>
<div class="verse">That thou would&#8217;st holily; would&#8217;st not play false,</div>
<div class="verse">And yet would&#8217;st wrongly win.</div>
</div></div>

<p>And that we may be in no doubt as to the
original source from which this diabolical plot
proceeded, Shakespeare makes the truth doubly
plain to us in a subsequent passage. When the
hesitation, which she had feared, threatens to
wreck their cherished scheme of crime, she
reminds him that in its inception the idea was
his, not hers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent9">What beast was&#8217;t, then,</div>
<div class="verse">That made you break this enterprise to me?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<hr class="tb" />
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent14">Nor time, nor place,</div>
<div class="verse">Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:</div>
<div class="verse">They have made themselves, and that their fitness now</div>
<div class="verse">Does unmake you.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Nor, indeed, would the conduct of either be
humanly explicable unless we clearly grasp the
situation as it is here plainly stated by Shakespeare.
Her superlative strength in executive
resource is only consistent with the assumption
that she has accepted without questioning a
policy that was none of her own devising: his
apparent weakness, on the other hand, is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
inevitable attitude of an imaginative temperament
which feels all the responsibilities and
forecasts the consequences of the crime it has
conceived.</p>

<p>And this brings us to a consideration of the
particular types of character which have been
chosen by Shakespeare for the two principal
figures of his tragedy. I have suggested that
the ideal motive of the drama lies in its contrast
of the distinctive qualities of sex as these are
developed under the pressure of a combined
purpose and a common experience: and it will
be found, at any rate, that the special individuality
which the author has assigned to Macbeth
not less than to his wife aptly serves the end I
have supposed he had in view. Dr. Johnson
has said of the play, that &#8220;it has no nice
discriminations of character; the events are too
great to admit the influence of particular dispositions,
and the course of the action necessarily
determines the conduct of the agents.&#8221; This,
of course, is putting the matter too crudely.
Shakespeare was not wont to deal in abstractions,
though by the force of his imagination he could
so inform his work as to raise the exhibition of
individual nature into an image of our common
humanity. Still less can he be accused of
inventing mere puppets with no other function
than to carry the chosen legend to its close.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
His characters always outlive the particular
circumstances in which they are employed:
they are enriched by a thousand touches of
reality not absolutely needed for the requirements
of the scene, which allow us to pursue
them in imagination beyond the margin of the
printed page. But there is at least this truth
underlying Johnson&#8217;s criticism, that, accepting
the malign influences under which their natures
are exhibited, there is nothing abnormal in the
character of either; and that what is particularly
distinctive about them has been added with the
view of giving ideal emphasis to tendencies that
are common to us all.</p>

<p>We shall realise this the better as we come
to examine more nearly their conduct and bearing
towards the one terrible circumstance that
dominates the lives of both. For it must never
be forgotten that in the play of <i>Macbeth</i> the
murder of Duncan means all. It is the touchstone
by which temperament and disposition
are tried and developed; the instrument of
evolution which the poet has found ready to
his hand, and which he has wielded with all
the extraordinary force of his genius. The first
of a long list of horrors committed by Macbeth,
it nevertheless in essence contains them all; and
though it hurries his unfortunate partner by a
more terrible passage to a swifter doom, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
illumines as by lightning-flashes every phase
of the woman&#8217;s nature, from the first passionate
impulse of evil to the remorse that cannot find
refuge even in madness, and is only silenced by
death.</p>

<p>On the threshold of this terrible adventure
in what mood do we find them? The project,
as we have seen, is no stranger to the breast of
either, and yet with what strangely different
effect has the poison worked its spell! They
have been apart, and the soul of each has been
thrown back upon itself. In the thick of action,
&#8220;disdaining fortune with his brandished steel,&#8221;
Macbeth has become infirm of purpose: alone
in her castle at Inverness, Lady Macbeth has
brooded over the crime until it has completely
possessed her. With the concentration of a
woman&#8217;s nature, she has driven from her brain
all other thoughts save this: and she waits now
with impatient expectancy for the hour that
shall put her courage to the proof. Here, as we
see, the divergence of sex has already asserted
itself, working such a transformation that when
they meet they scarcely recognise one another.
The sudden coming of the occasion so long
plotted and desired by both has hastened the
development of individual character. He finds
in the &#8220;dearest partner&#8221; of his greatness a
being so formidable that he regards her for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
the moment with feelings of mingled admiration
and dismay:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Bring forth men-children only;</div>
<div class="verse">For thy undaunted metal should compose</div>
<div class="verse">Nothing but males.</div>
</div></div>

<p>And though, with the woman&#8217;s finer instinct,
she has partly divined and anticipated his mood,
she is appalled at the extent of the change it
has wrought in him. Beneath the armour of
the valiant soldier she finds, as she thinks, the
trembling heart of a coward, and struck with
sudden terror at his failing purpose, she tries to
recall him to his former self:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">When you durst do it, then you were a man;</div>
<div class="verse">And, to be more than what you were, you would</div>
<div class="verse">Be so much more the man.</div>
</div></div>

<p>From this moment they are strangers in
spirit, though the old bond still holds them
together. And yet to us, who view the whole
picture with the poet&#8217;s larger vision, the process
of development moves in obedience to inevitable
law. For at such a crisis it is natural in a man
to anticipate: in a woman to remember; on the
eve of action he looks forward with apprehension:
on the morrow she looks back with
regret; and while his nature is stronger in
restraint, hers, on the contrary, surrenders itself
more completely to the passion of remorse.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
The finer moral feelings of a woman are retrospective,
for her imagination feeds and broods
upon the past. She is often more intrepid in
action because the intensity of her purpose bars
the view of consequence; and whether the
enterprise be heroic or malign, her indifference
to danger, which then far surpasses the courage
of man, is never so superbly illustrated as when
she labours in his service, and not for any ends
of her own. And so it happens that where she
only follows she sometimes seems to lead, and
the man, who has devised the policy which
her readier resource only avails to carry into
execution, appears in the guise of the reluctant
victim of her stronger purpose and more undaunted
will.</p>

<p>In order the better to exhibit these tendencies
of her sex, Shakespeare has pictured for us in
Lady Macbeth a woman of the highest nervous
organisation, whose deep devotion gives to her
character a passionate intensity of purpose that
seems at times to be more than human. While
the troubled surface of Macbeth&#8217;s mind sends
back but a blurred image of the dark secret
that it hides, in her transparent nature the guilty
project of his ambition is clearly and sharply
mirrored. Before the murder of Duncan she
can see nothing but the crime and its reward,
that crime&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Which shall to all our nights and days to come</div>
<div class="verse">Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Macbeth&#8217;s message has reminded her that the
time is drawing near, and she resolves to chase
from his brain&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">All that impedes thee from the golden round,</p>

<p>which the witches have placed upon his brow.
In the next moment she hears of the king&#8217;s
expected arrival, and then she knows that the
hour so long awaited has come at last, and she
nerves herself for the one supreme effort of her
life:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The raven himself is hoarse</div>
<div class="verse">That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan</div>
<div class="verse">Under my battlements. Come, you spirits</div>
<div class="verse">That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here;</div>
<div class="verse">And fill me, from the crown to the toe, top-full</div>
<div class="verse">Of direst cruelty!</div>
</div></div>

<p>But it is a vain cry; for throughout the
terrible experiences of the next few hours the
feminine nature is ever dominant. If there are
no women save those who deal in gentle deeds,
then Jael did not drive the nail into the forehead
of Sisera, and it was not Judith&#8217;s hand that
compassed the death of Holofernes. And yet,
if such as they were truly of the sex which
claims them, by a still firmer title may we say
of Lady Macbeth that she is every inch a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
woman. It is the woman who in this same
scene greets her husband on his return:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Great Glamis! worthy Cawdor!</div>
<div class="verse">Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!</div>
<div class="verse">Thy letters have transported me beyond</div>
<div class="verse">This ignorant present, and I feel now</div>
<div class="verse">The future in the instant.</div>
</div></div>

<p>And in &#8220;the instant&#8221; she now lives, looking
neither before nor after; for the future that she
sees stretches no further than the dreaded deed
which is to bring fulfilment of all their cherished
hopes. As she has shut out the past, with whatever
compassionate scruples it might recall, so
in like manner her fixed concentration on the
business in hand excludes all vision of the time
to come. If she had been endowed with
Macbeth&#8217;s imagination, which could ride so
swiftly on the track of consequence, Duncan
would indeed have gone forth on the morrow
as he purposed. It needed this fatal combination
to effect what neither would have accomplished
alone&mdash;the man&#8217;s guilty conception poisoning
and possessing the woman&#8217;s soul, the woman&#8217;s
surrender to his will so complete and passionate
that when he falters she stands before him as
the glittering image of his former self, a superb
creation of his own brain, endowed with all,
and more than all, the courage he had lost.
This is Lady Macbeth on the eve of Duncan&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
murder. From the moment that she perceives
his wavering resolution she takes the yoke of
action on to her own shoulders. She contrives
and schemes every detail of the crime, and
with ever-increasing impetuosity urges his failing
footsteps towards the goal he now fears to
reach. But the precious moments are speeding
onward, and her passionate arguments seem
powerless to lift his sickened spirit; till at the
last, with all the rhetoric of despair, she presents
to his affrighted gaze a blackened image of
herself, thinking, as well she may, that such a
vision will prove more potent than curses to fan
into flame the dying embers of his resolve:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent8">I have given suck, and know</div>
<div class="verse">How tender &#8217;tis to love the babe that milks me;</div>
<div class="verse">I would, while it was smiling in my face,</div>
<div class="verse">Have pluck&#8217;d my nipple from his boneless gums,</div>
<div class="verse">And dash&#8217;d the brains out, had I so sworn as you</div>
<div class="verse">Have done to this.</div>
</div></div>

<p>It seems almost incredible, but it is nevertheless
true, that this frenzied appeal has over and
again been accepted as Lady Macbeth&#8217;s judicial
report upon her own character. A speech which
is conceived in the most daring spirit of dramatic
fitness, and which bears in every word the stamp
of the special purpose for which it is uttered, is
transformed into a prosaic statement of fact; and
we can only wonder we are not also invited to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
believe that this somewhat rigorous treatment of
the young accounts for the fact that the play contains
no mention of the lady&#8217;s surviving offspring.</p>

<p>When the scene in which the awful passage
occurs has drawn to its close, Lady Macbeth&#8217;s
task is already more than half accomplished. Her
fiery eloquence has roused him from his stupor,
and, inspired by the dauntless spirit which he had
himself inspired, he bends up &#8220;each corporal
agent to this terrible feat.&#8221; But she does not
rest until all is finished; she never falters till the
goal is passed. The woman&#8217;s quivering nerves,
more potent than the iron sinews of a giant, bear
her up safely to the end; and then, with a
woman&#8217;s weakness, they break, not beneath the
weight they bear, but beneath the weight they
have borne. So long as the need of action endures
she remains unflinching and undismayed. It is
she who drugs the grooms in preparation for the
murder: it is she who at the supreme moment,
when he can do no more, revisits the chamber of
death to complete what he has left undone:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent10">Infirm of purpose!</div>
<div class="verse">Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead</div>
<div class="verse">Are but as pictures: &#8217;tis the eye of childhood</div>
<div class="verse">That fears a painted devil.</div>
</div></div>

<p>A speech which shows how little she knew
herself; for throughout all her brief after-life
this picture of &#8220;the sleeping and the dead&#8221; is set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
in flames before her haunted vision and burnt
with fire into the depths of her soul.</p>

<p>From this time forward Macbeth and his wife
change places. In outward seeming at least,
their positions are reversed, though when we
look beneath the surface there is an inexorable
consistency in the conduct of both. He, whose
imagination had foreseen all the consequences of
this initial step in crime, braces himself without
hesitation to the completion of his fatal task;
she, who had foreseen nothing, is thrown back
upon the past, her dormant imagination now
terribly alert, and picturing to her broken spirit
all the horrors she had previously ignored. As
the penalty of his crime is unresting action, her
heavier doom is isolated despair; and it is
significant to observe that it is she who suffers
most acutely all the moral torments he had only
anticipated for himself. Macbeth indeed had
&#8220;murdered sleep,&#8221; but it was her sleep he had
murdered as well as his own; and the blood that,
he feared, not &#8220;all great Neptune&#8217;s ocean&#8221; would
wash away, counts for little with one who afterwards
plunged breast-high into the full tide of
blood, but remains with her a haunting memory
to the end. This change is already well marked
in the scene immediately following the murder,
when he suddenly wrests the conduct of affairs
from her hands, and she sinks appalled at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
dark vista of unending crime which his readiness
in resource now first opens to her view. He
who before had stood with trembling feet upon
the brink of the stream now rushes headlong into
the flood; to complete the chain of suspicion,
he murders the two grooms without an instant&#8217;s
hesitation; and before the next Act opens he has
already planned the death of Banquo and his son.</p>

<p>But from this point he proceeds alone. Her
help is no longer needed, and even if it were not so,
she has none now to give. &#8220;Naught&#8217;s had, all&#8217;s
spent.&#8221; Her dream is shattered; the vision of
glory is fled away into the night, and she who
had felt &#8220;the future in the instant&#8221; can only
brood over the wreck of the past. The crown
for which she had struggled presses like molten
lead into her brain; the lamp which has lighted
her so far only flings its rays backward on the
blood-stained pathway she has trodden; and,
bitterest of all to her woman&#8217;s soul, the evil she
had wrought for his sake now breaks their lives
asunder and parts them for ever. For his spirit
has no access to the anguish of remorse that is fast
hurrying her to the tomb, and she on her side
can take no part in those darker projects with
which he seeks to buttress the tottering fabric of
his ambition. In all tragedy there is nothing so
pitiful in its pathos as the passage in which she
strives to grant to her husband the support of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
which she herself stands so sorely in need. She
feels instinctively that he shuns her company, and
surmises that he too is suffering the lonely pangs
of remorse, little guessing that he comes to her
fresh from a new scheme of murder:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">How now, my lord? why do you keep alone,</div>
<div class="verse">Of sorriest fancies your companions making?</div>
<div class="verse">Using those thoughts which should indeed have died</div>
<div class="verse">With them they think on? Things without all remedy,</div>
<div class="verse">Should be without regard: what&#8217;s done, is done.</div>
</div></div>

<p>With what a jarring note comes his answer:</p>

<p class="center">We have scotched the snake, not killed it.</p>

<p>And yet, despite this answer, with its clear
indication of the true drift of his thoughts, she
still fails to realise the gulf that divides them.
All through the banquet scene she cannot rid
herself of the belief that he is haunted, as she is
haunted, by the vision of the murdered king,
and even when he strips off the mask and bares
the inner workings of his breast&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent10">For mine own good,</div>
<div class="verse">All causes shall give way; I am in blood</div>
<div class="verse">Stepp&#8217;d in so far, that, should I wade no more,</div>
<div class="verse">Returning were as tedious as go o&#8217;er,</div>
</div></div>

<p>she listens without understanding, and still interpreting
his sufferings by her own, answers
him from the sleepless anguish of her own soul:</p>

<p class="center">You lack the season of all natures, sleep.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>In the interval, before we meet Lady Macbeth
again, and for the last time, she has learnt all;
and beneath the weight of her guilty knowledge
her shattered nerves have snapped and broken.
Throughout the wandering utterances of her
dying hours her imagination is unalterably fixed
upon the scene and circumstances of Duncan&#8217;s
death, but across this unchanging background
flit other spectres besides that of the murdered
king. Banquo is there, and Macduff&#8217;s unhappy
wife: she is spared no item in the dreary
catalogue of her husband&#8217;s crimes; and yet,
always overpowering these more recent memories,
come the thick-crowding thoughts of that one
fatal hour, when her spirit shot like a flame
across the sky, and then fell headlong down the
dark abyss of night.</p>

<p>The character of Macbeth standing in vivid
contrast to that of his wife, has been subject to
an equal amount of misconception, though of
a different sort. He is commonly represented
as being pursued by the constant warnings of
conscience, which are only silenced by the evil
ascendancy of the commanding figure at his
elbow. But this is to antedate the action of
the drama, and to mistake the real basis of his
nature. If the voice of conscience ever gained
a hearing, it was in some earlier hour, not
pictured by Shakespeare, before this settled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
scheme of murder had taken firm possession of
his soul. The opening chorus of the witches,
no less than the bearing of the man himself,
warn us that he has long ceased to wrestle with
the messengers of Heaven, and that he is now
under the dominion of influences that have a
different origin. The forces that sway Macbeth
as we know him are intellectual rather than
moral, and in order to exhibit more effectively
that tendency to deliberation which is characteristic
of his sex, Shakespeare has endowed him
with the most potent imagination, which presents
the consequences of conduct as clearly as though
the secrets of the future were mirrored in a
glass. It is not conscience, the whispered echo
of eternal law, which causes him to falter on
the verge of action: it is the instinct of security,
which, as Hecate sings:</p>

<p class="center">Is mortal&#8217;s chiefest enemy.</p>

<p>And so indeed it proved; for the initial step
in crime once past, the very forces that had been
strongest in restraint now carry him with unhalting
speed through crime after crime, until
his headlong course is stayed by the hand of
Macduff. And seeing that Macbeth&#8217;s keen
vision had pictured what was in store for him,
it is no wonder that he trembles with irresolute
purpose while his wife&#8217;s blind impulse moves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
with unbroken strength. In his case it is
neither conscience nor cowardice that cries halt,
but an imagination morbidly vivid and alert,
which sees the oak in the acorn, and converts
the trickling spring into the full tide of the
river that rushes to the sea. All this is plainly
imaged for us in the soliloquy that follows his
first interview with his wife:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">If it were done, when &#8217;tis done, then &#8217;twere well</div>
<div class="verse">It were done quickly: if the assassination</div>
<div class="verse">Could trammel up the consequence, and catch,</div>
<div class="verse">With his surcease, success; that but this blow</div>
<div class="verse">Might be the be-all and the end-all here,</div>
<div class="verse">But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,</div>
<div class="verse">We&#8217;d jump the life to come. But, in these cases,</div>
<div class="verse">We still have judgment here; that we but teach</div>
<div class="verse">Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return</div>
<div class="verse">To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice</div>
<div class="verse">Commends the ingredients of our poisoned chalice</div>
<div class="verse">To our own lips.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Then in the passage that follows he realises
in more particular detail the horror and execration
which such a deed will awaken. Duncan&#8217;s
virtues, he sees,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>Here we see set forth in clearest language
both the scope and the limit of Macbeth&#8217;s moral
vision; and as we note his growing irresolution,
it is impossible not to be reminded of another
of Shakespeare&#8217;s characters in whom the imaginative
temperament worked with equal potency.
Macbeth and Hamlet are in some points
strangely allied, but when they are placed side
by side the elements of antagonism quickly
overpower the outward appearance of similarity.
Both were men in whom the supremacy of the
imagination induced paralysis of action, but in
the one case its exercise is bounded by the
limits of our present world, and in the other
it starts from the confines of mortal life and
seeks to pierce the veil of eternity. Macbeth
takes no heed of what may lurk in those dark
recesses beyond the grave; if he can only be
assured of safety here he is ready to &#8220;jump the
life to come.&#8221; To Hamlet, on the other hand,
the fortune of this world, and even death itself,
are but as shadows, for his imagination is
haunted by the mysteries of that unseen realm
of which death is but the portal&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The undiscovered country, from whose bourne</div>
<div class="verse">No traveller returns.</div>
</div></div>

<p>It is this which &#8220;puzzles the will&#8221; and arrests
the uplifted arm, and though the voice that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
urges him to action comes to him from the
grave, the very fact that the command is borne
by a supernatural messenger suffices to ensure
its neglect, and sends the imagination once
more adrift upon the limitless ocean of eternity.
Macbeth too trafficks in the supernatural, but
with what different purpose and result! He
holds converse with the weird sisters only that
Fate may echo the dark project he fears to
utter; and when he consults these &#8220;black and
midnight hags&#8221; again, it is to wring from their
lips the knowledge that may guide him still
further in his settled career of crime. And
they answer him according to his will. He is
already far advanced in blood, but they beckon
him still onward, and, speaking with the double
tongue of hope and fear, bid him beware, and
yet be bold, leading him by such sure steps to
his doom that the struggle at last becomes
almost sublime, and Fate, which he had rashly
challenged, enters the lists against him.</p>

<p>When we have once grasped the motive-power
of Macbeth&#8217;s character, it is not difficult
to reconcile the apparent inconsistency in his
conduct before and after the murder of Duncan.
By this one act his trembling hesitation is
suddenly converted into an iron consistency of
purpose. The view of consequence that had
held him for a while irresolute on the threshold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
of crime now becomes the strongest incentive to
whatever may be needed to make his position
secure. His imagination is thus both the source
of inaction and the spur that urges him to
morbid activity: it is at once the friend of
conscience and its bitterest foe: at one moment
the lamp that reveals to him his hideous design
and all its attendant train of evil, in the next
a lurid flame that lights up a thousand avenues
of danger, only to be guarded by the exercise
of a relentless cruelty and an unflinching courage.
In nearly every utterance of Macbeth after the
murder we are allowed to see how clearly he
himself apprehends the danger of his position,
and the sinister policy which it demands.
&#8220;Things bad begun make strong themselves
by ill&#8221;; and accordingly, with no more compunction
than an executioner might feel, he
proceeds in the course of action which he had
foreseen from the first to be inevitable. Even
his superstitious fears do not shake him in his
resolve, and he has no sooner recovered from
the vision of Banquo&#8217;s ghost than he determines
to visit again the weird sisters, that he may
know &#8220;by the worst means the worst.&#8221;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,</div>
<div class="verse">Which must be acted ere they may be scanned.</div>
</div></div>

<p>This is the first intimation that we have of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
any menace to the safety of Macduff, and when,
in a following scene, Macbeth hears of his flight
to England, he is full of self-reproaches for his
procrastination in crime:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The flighty purpose never is o&#8217;ertook</div>
<div class="verse">Unless the deed go with it: from this moment,</div>
<div class="verse">The very firstlings of my heart shall be</div>
<div class="verse">The firstlings of my hand.</div>
</div></div>

<p>And then, baulked in his guilty designs upon
the husband, he straightway resolves to wreak
his vengeance upon his family:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The castle of Macduff I will surprise;</div>
<div class="verse">Seize upon Fife; and give to the edge o&#8217; the sword</div>
<div class="verse">His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls</div>
<div class="verse">That trace him in his line.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Truly indeed and with prophetic vision had
he said to his wife that he was &#8220;but young in
deed,&#8221; and that his terror at Banquo&#8217;s ghost was
only &#8220;the initiate fear that wants hard use.&#8221;</p>

<p>And yet, despite this full revelation of the
man&#8217;s nature, who can fail to be moved by the
splendid despair of his closing hours, when, with
all the forces of heaven and earth arrayed against
him, he struggles with dauntless courage to
the end? His imagination, still informing his
shattered spirit, lights up the ruin of his life, and
presents to his wearied gaze the hated object that
he has become in the sight of all men:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent7">My way of life</div>

<div class="verse">Curses not loud, but deep, mouth-honour, breath,</div>
<div class="verse">Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not.</div>
</div></div>

<p>There is no refuge of madness for him. He
has seen the end from the beginning, and even
when the end has come it has no terror which
he had not known long ago. This only is added
to his earlier knowledge, though the truth, alas!
comes too late, that this present life, which he
had held so dear, and for which he had sacrificed
all, this life, which had been the tomb of his
virtue, and of his honour, is</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div>

<p>And so, with the &#8220;sound and fury&#8221; of this

<h2 class="nobreak">HENRY IRVING</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> value of personality on the stage has rarely
been exhibited with greater force than in the
case of Sir Henry Irving. Nature had not
specially equipped him for his calling; in several
respects, indeed, she had weighted him with
disabilities which were destined to prove a
serious hindrance in the progress of his career.
But she had dowered him, as if by way of
compensation, with a force and persistence of
character that finally shaped for themselves a
mode of expression which satisfied the demands
of his ambition. And this sense of resident
power was mirrored in the man himself, even
in the earlier days when those physical peculiarities,
which he never wholly lost, were, for the
time, gravely imperilling his success upon the
stage.</p>

<p>I met him first at the Old Albion Tavern
in Drury Lane&mdash;a favourite haunt of actors that
has long passed away&mdash;and I remember then
that the man himself impressed me more deeply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
than any of the few impersonations in which I
had seen him. Already in his face and in his
bearing he contrived to convey a curious sense
of power and authority that he had not yet
found the means to incorporate completely in his
work upon the stage. I found myself vaguely
wondering why he should have chosen the
actor&#8217;s calling as a means of impressing himself
upon his generation, and yet at the time I felt
a full assurance that in that or in some other
walk of life he was bound to leave a mark
upon his time. Johnson once said of Burke
that if a stranger should take shelter beside
him from the rain, he would part from him
with the feeling that chance had brought him
in contact with a remarkable man. Something
of that same feeling was left in me as the
impression drawn from my first meeting with
Irving; and it is perhaps characteristic of that
unnameable kind of force his personality suggested,
that even at the zenith of his career, when
he had won complete authority over a public
that at first only reluctantly rallied to his banner,
there was still room left for a measure of doubt
as to whether his powers might not have found
a fuller exercise in a different realm. It is, I
think, however, an attribute of all the very
highest achievement in any art that its authors,
even when their special aptitude for the chosen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
medium of expression is full and complete,
possess, by right of their genius, something more
and something different in kind from that particular
endowment which the art they have
adopted calls into exercise. In Irving&#8217;s case, this
thought marked itself more deeply, because, as
I have already hinted, his command of the special
resources of his art was by no means complete,
and his whole career may be said to have been
a struggle, fiercer and more obstinate than most
men have to wage, to secure, through the medium
of the theatre, a full recognition of the latent
forces he undoubtedly possessed.</p>

<p>He was conscious of that himself, and would
often openly avow it; very conscious, I mean,
that, in a calling in which there is no escape
from the physical presence of the artist, he had
much to contend with. It made him quickly
appreciative of the kind of perfection achieved
by others in whom the motive and the means
of expression were more finely attuned; and he
never wearied in later days of appraising this
quality in the acting of Ellen Terry, whose varied
gifts in the moment of perfection were combined
in a fashion so easy and so absolute as sometimes
almost to rob her of the praise due to conscious art.</p>

<p>Such appreciation would sometimes, though
not so often, be extended to the comrades of
his own sex; and I recollect, during the time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
when William Terriss was a member of his
company, he would comment, with a sense of
half-humorous envy, upon the ease and grace
with which the younger actor could at once
establish himself in the favour of his audience.
But this recognition of the qualities he knew
himself not to possess never, I think, for a
moment shook his deeper conviction that, when
he could subdue to the service of his art the
more refractory elements of his own physical
personality, he had a message to convey which
would carry a deeper and more lasting impression.</p>

<p>And he proved by his career that he had a
true title to that conviction. Force was always
there, force that showed itself almost to the point
of terror in his early impersonation of &#8220;The
Bells.&#8221; But sweetness and grace came not till
later, and was only won as the reward of patient
and unceasing effort: it was the case of the
honeycomb bedded in the carcase of the lion,
and it took all a lion&#8217;s strength to reveal it
to the world. In the man himself, however, as
distinguished from his art, it was present from
the first; and I recall, in those earlier days of
our friendship, that a certain grave courtliness
of bearing was among the first things that struck
me. A certain sense of loneliness and isolation
always belonged to him&mdash;the index, as it seemed
to me, of a mind that was conscious that in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
case the road towards fame must be trodden alone;
that such perfection as he could ultimately achieve
could borrow little from example, but must be
due to his own unaided subjugation of whatever
in his individuality impeded his progress.</p>

<p>But this suggestion was never so far obtruded
as to burden the freedom of personal intercourse,
and my long association with him, in work or
at play, is rich in the remembrance of many
varied moods of a sweet and affectionate character.
In common with all men who remain permanently
attractive in companionship, he had a quick
and delicate sense of humour, sometimes half-mischievous
in its exercise, and touched now and
then with a slightly saturnine quality, but always
ready at call&mdash;even in his most serious moods.</p>

<p>One evening during a brief holiday with him
in Paris it was somewhat roughly put to the
test. We stood in a group of spectators watching
the agile performances of some dancers who were
exhibiting the wayward figures of the Can-Can,
when one of the more adventurous of the troupe,
greatly daring, suddenly lifted her foot and neatly
removed the hat that Irving was wearing. The
other spectators, some of whom, I think, had
recognised the actor, and all of whom, as I
had remarked, were attracted by his personality,
stood in momentary wonder as to how this
audacious act of familiarity might be received,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
and I thought that I myself detected in Irving&#8217;s
face a momentary struggle between the dignity
that was natural to him and the genial acceptance
of the spirit of the place in which we found
ourselves. But it was only momentary, and
when he acknowledged with hearty laughter the
adroitness of the performer, the Parisians around
us found themselves free to indulge in the
merriment which the look upon his grave, pale
face had for the time held in check.</p>

<p>Upon such lighter phases of the life of the
French capital Irving looked with a half-sinister
tolerance.</p>

<p>That aspect of the character of the French
people made no sympathetic appeal to him, but
he watched their antics with unceasing interest
rather as he might have watched the uncouth
gambols of animals in a menagerie. But there
was one of the shows of Paris which positively
fascinated him, and that was the Morgue.
Irving&#8217;s mind was always attracted to the study
of crime; he loved to trace its motives, to
examine and to probe the various modes of the
criminal character; and so it happened that, on
one pretext or another, our morning wanderings
nearly always led us back to this gruesome
exhibition. One day the fancy seized him that
a man who passed before one of the corpses and
then returned to gaze upon it again was possibly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
the murderer himself; and afterwards, while we
were breakfasting at Bignons, he occupied himself
with a sense of keen enjoyment in tracing
in imagination the motive of the crime and the
means by which it had been carried out.</p>

<p>At that time his thoughts were greatly occupied
with the proposed revival of <i>Macbeth</i>, and on
several evenings at the Hotel Bristol we sat
long into the night discussing every phase of that
greatest of all poetic tragedies. I think Irving
felt&mdash;partly, perhaps, as the result of our many
discussions&mdash;that in his earlier presentation of
the play he had dwelt too insistently upon the
purely criminal side of Macbeth&#8217;s character to
the neglect of its larger and more imaginative
issues. I know, at any rate, that he was so far
impressed with my view of the play, that he
asked me to write an essay upon the subject
which was to appear simultaneously with the
revival; and he did this in part, I believe,
because the view I entertained of the interplay
of motive between Macbeth and his guilty
partner went far to supplant that masculine
conception of Lady Macbeth&#8217;s character which
had hitherto been imposed upon the world
mainly through the genius of Mrs. Siddons.
The essay, no less than the performance, proved,
as we had expected, the mark for much hostile
criticism; but the revival&mdash;interesting to me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
in many respects&mdash;illustrated with surprising
force the extraordinary advance in his art which
had been made by Irving since the earlier
production of the play&mdash;an advance not merely
of technical resource, but even more as showing
the larger and profounder spirit in which he
could now approach the poetic drama.</p>

<p>Nearly all our excursions abroad were in
some way associated with work projected or
already in hand, and it was while he was preparing
Mr. W. G. Wills&#8217;s version of <i>Faust</i> that
we made together a long and delightful excursion
to Nuremberg. Irving was very anxious to find
something that was both quaint and characteristic
for the scene of Margaret&#8217;s Garden, and although
he was not very fond of physical exercise, he
never wearied of our constant tramps among the
narrower streets of the old German city in
inquisitive search for something that should fit
with the ideal that he had in his mind. We
trespassed freely wherever we found an open
gateway; and at last, having failed to discover
what was exactly suited to the purpose, we set
out one day for Rothenburg on the Tauber&mdash;one
of the most perfect and complete examples of
a mediaeval city, and where, as we were assured,
we should find richer material than was provided
in Nuremberg itself.</p>

<p>At that time the journey between Nuremberg<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
and Rothenburg had to be made mainly by
road; the railway carried us only half-way, and
then we had a drive of several hours before
reaching our destination. I think it was this
that mainly attracted Irving in undertaking the
excursion. All through his life he clearly loved
the pleasure of a drive; and during a week I spent
with him at Lucerne, our every day, for six or
seven hours at a stretch, was employed in exploring
the shores of the lake. Rothenburg, as it
chanced, furnished us with little new material
towards the object of which we were in quest,
and on our return to Albert Durer&#8217;s city, feeling
that he had exhausted all the available means of
inquiry, he at once, with characteristic promptitude,
summoned the scenic artist, Mr. Hawes
Craven, from London in order that he might
make notes on the spot of the several scenes
of the drama.</p>

<p>At home or abroad, Irving was always at his
best as a host, and, whether in the larger entertainments
which he sometimes gave on the
stage of the Lyceum, or in the more intimate
gatherings in the Beefsteak Room, he presided
with admirable grace over a company that was
often strangely varied in its composition&mdash;the
most distinguished statesmen, soldiers, and men
of letters, meeting in happy association with
chosen members of his own profession. Two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
little incidents recur to me which illustrate in
their different ways that sense of humour, sometimes
innocently mischievous, and sometimes
again employed for a long settled purpose of
deliberate attack. The first of these occasions
was a dinner given in honour of the members
of the Saxe-Meiningen company on the stage
of the theatre. I had been driving with him
during the day, and happened to mention, to his
manifest surprise, that I had not seen their
great performance of the play of <i>Julius Caesar</i>
which was making a considerable stir in London.
He said nothing more at the time, but at the
end of the evening&#8217;s feast, after having himself
in a few words gracefully welcomed his distinguished
guests, he announced that he would
now call upon Mr. Comyns Carr, who he felt
sure would do ample justice to the exquisite art
of these German players. I can see now the
smile upon his face as he sat down, and left me
to my task, of which I acquitted myself with
at least so much skill, that he was the only one
among those present who was aware that I was
wholly unacquainted with the subject I had
been summoned to discuss.</p>

<p>The other incident to which I have referred
had a more serious import. During his first visit
to America his feelings had been gravely outraged,
and not on his own account alone, by a series of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
scandalous articles which had appeared in one
of the most popular of New York journals. Our
party that evening at supper in the Beefsteak
Room included a popular American Colonel, a
great friend of Irving&#8217;s, and, as Irving well
knew, a great friend also of the wealthy proprietor
of this offending journal. The scene
was wholly characteristic of Irving, who rarely
forgot an injury, although he was content sometimes
to lie long in wait for the fitting occasion
to strike a counter-blow. In a genial prelude
he led our American friend on in a growing
crescendo of praise of the amiable qualities of
the wealthy newspaper proprietor. &#8220;You know
so-and-so,&#8221; he innocently remarked to his guest,
as he settled himself down in his chair, in an
attitude that not uncommonly conveyed to those
who knew him that danger might be impending.
&#8220;Know him!&#8221; replied the innocent
Colonel, &#8220;I have known him all my life.&#8221;
&#8220;Quite so,&#8221; said Irving; &#8220;good fellow, isn&#8217;t
he?&#8221; &#8220;Good! He&#8217;s one of the very best
fellows that was ever born.&#8221; &#8220;The kind of
man,&#8221; pursued Irving, &#8220;who would never do an
ungenerous or an unkind thing?&#8221; And at this,
lured on to his doom, the unsuspecting Colonel
burst forth in such unrestrained eulogy of his
friend, as to depict for the admiration of those
present a character of almost unchallenged perfection.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
&#8220;No doubt; no doubt,&#8221; responded
Irving; &#8220;no doubt he is all that you say&#8221;; and
then, in words all the deadlier for the perfect
quietude of tone in which they were uttered,
he added: &#8220;But he is also one of the damned&#8217;st
scoundrels that ever stepped the earth.&#8221; The
genial Colonel was not unnaturally taken aback;
but before he could make any show of defence,
Irving had whipped from his breast-pocket the
series of offending articles, and, handing them
across the table, made the simple comment, &#8220;I
thought, old friend, you might be interested to
see them.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was, I think, in the beginning of the year
1892 that Irving invited me to write for him a
play on the subject of King Arthur. The theme
had long been in his mind, and before his death
Mr. Wills had completed a version, which proved,
however, unacceptable to the actor. At first
Irving thought that I might find it possible to
recast and remodel Wills&#8217;s work; but it was
afterwards agreed between us that I should be
free to work out my own design. When my
task was completed, Irving and Miss Terry came
one night to dine with us in Blandford Square.
He brought with him also his little dog Fussy,
the constant companion of many years. And
when dinner was over, he settled himself down in
an arm-chair, with the dog upon his knees, prepared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
for an ordeal that is never wholly agreeable
either to the author or his auditor. I know that
I was nervous enough, as I always am on such
occasions; and when I was about half-way
through, the audible sounds of snoring which
reached my ears made me fancy in my morbid
state of sensitiveness that I had failed to grip or
to hold the attention of the man I so strongly
desired to please. Still I plodded on, not daring
to lift my eyes from the book, and still the
stertorous sounds continued, until at last, exasperated
beyond endurance, I closed the book, with
the abrupt announcement that I felt it useless to
go on. &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; inquired Irving,
in blank amazement. &#8220;Why, you were asleep,&#8221;
I replied; but even as I spoke, I perceived the
ridiculous blunder into which I had fallen, for
the snoring still continued without interruption,
and, lifting my eyes, I saw Miss Terry, with
laughing gesture, pointing to the sleeping terrier
still resting upon Irving&#8217;s knees. I had &#8220;tried it
on the dog,&#8221; and it was the dog I had failed to
please.</p>

<p>My association with Irving during the
preparation of <i>King Arthur</i> was wholly interesting
and delightful. I had been warned by those
who had long worked with him in the theatre
that Irving was intolerant of interference, and
that I would do well not to assume any position<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
of authority in the direction of the rehearsals.
My own experience, however, completely belied
this warning; from the first he treated me
with the utmost consideration, and invited, rather
than repressed, the suggestions I had to make.
His own work at rehearsal was always deeply
interesting to watch, though it often revealed
little more than the mechanical part of his own
performance. This, however, he fixed with
absolute exactitude, and the minute invention
of detail which he displayed sufficed to suggest
that in his own private study of the part this
fabric of mechanism was already wedded to the
emotional message he intended to convey. As
a rule, he was word-perfect before the rehearsals
of any play began, and this left him free to
bestow infinite patience and pains upon the work
of others. He would go through the whole of
any one of the minor parts, instructing the actor
in every detail of gesture and movement; and
when it came to scenes in which he himself
was concerned, he knew precisely&mdash;and could
precisely realise&mdash;the pace and the tone that
were needed to achieve the effect he desired.</p>

It has been often attempted, never, however,
with any convincing success; and sometimes
with such cumbrous elaboration of thought as
to leave upon the reader only the desolating
impression that the philosopher was wholly
lacking in the quality which he sought to define.
Nor is its presence so common even in those
who most loudly deplore its absence in others.
I have heard the dullest of men lament the fact
that God has denied it to women, and the fleeting
smile with which such an announcement
is sometimes received by their wives goes far
to prove that even the intimate association of
marriage has not sufficed for the full appreciation
of character.</p>

<p>In its larger and more elemental forms humour
is certainly one of the rarest of human attributes;
and even the appreciation of humour in that
broader and deeper sense is not quite so common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
as is generally supposed. There is quite a considerable
body of seemingly educated opinion
which would concede to Shakespeare every gift
except the gift of humour; persons who would
regard Falstaff as a quite inconsiderable creation,
and who would dismiss Dogberry and the nurse
in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> as negligible portraits in
the great Shakespearean gallery. Once I remember
hearing this view put forward very
confidently in the presence of a brilliant essayist,
whose grave demeanour gave the critic some
ground for the belief that his unfavourable opinion
would meet with ready acceptance. After holding
forth at some length upon what he deemed
to be this rather puerile aspect of Shakespeare&#8217;s
genius, he ventured at the finish upon the direct
inquiry: &#8220;Now what, sir, do you think of
Shakespeare&#8217;s humour?&#8221; To which the reply
came in very quiet tones: &#8220;Well, the trouble
is, there is no other.&#8221;</p>

<p>The proposition need not be taken too literally,
but it contains a truth that cannot be ignored.
Shakespeare&#8217;s humour is as directly and as legitimately
the fruit of his wide and deep love of
life as the most sublime of his tragic creations.
The mind that drew the portrait of Falstaff owns
and claims the same large handwriting as that
which revealed the character of Macbeth; in
both there is an equal measure of mastery. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
that, naturally, suggests an element in humour
which, without risking the imprudence of definition,
may be said to separate it from mere wit.
The man of wit may distinguish and reveal the
incongruities of life but the humorist, not only
perceives them, but loves the characters in which
they reside. Among the humorists I have
met, this essential gift of sympathy has always,
as it seems to me, been a constant and dominating
force. It was not my fortune to know Charles
Dickens, but his transcendent humour may be
said to have dominated all who came within the
reach and range of his genius; and it may surely
be said of him, as it may be said of Shakespeare,
that he not only saw where the sources of
laughter lay, but that he loved the thing he
made laughable.</p>

<p>This was equally true of Bret Harte, who in
our talks together would always willingly own
his obligations to the great master; and there
is certainly no more touching tribute to Dickens&#8217;s
genius than is contained in the little poem with
which Bret Harte greeted the news of his death.
As is not uncommon with men of creative
humour, Bret Harte, in ordinary converse, gave
little hint of its possession. A man of grave
and reticent bearing, he made no attempt to shine
as a talker; and as far as my experience went,
rarely sought to draw the conversation into literary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
channels. He deliberately, as it would seem,
kept all that concerned his work as an artist
in a world apart; and his charm in companionship&mdash;which
was not inconsiderable&mdash;suggested
rather the tenderness and sympathy in his outlook
on life than his equal gift of humorous
appreciation. Those earlier meetings of the
Kinsmen Club, of which Bret Harte was a
member, brought together many humorous
spirits, and amongst them George du Maurier
and poor Randolph Caldecott, who, although
he too owned a grave exterior, partly due to
frailty of health, could on occasion break out
into a frolic mood that was irresistible in its sense
of fun.</p>

<p>But the draughtsmen for <i>Punch</i> in those
days, even when, as in the case of du Maurier
and Charles Keene, they could boast a higher
measure of purely artistic accomplishment, were
hardly comparable in their grasp of what is
essentially comic in character with their predecessor,
John Leech; and if we turn from the
work they produced to the men themselves, it
was not the possession of a sense of humour which
formed the main element in the social charm
they exercised. Du Maurier, in his conversation,
never sought to exhibit or to exploit this particular
side of his talent; and in our many talks
upon the subject of art it was evident that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
was rather on the alert to recognise what was
seriously beautiful in the work of his contemporaries.
He never tired in praise of Millais
whom, I think, he ranked as the supreme master
of his time; and, on the other hand, he never
quite settled in his mind, even up to the end
of his life, what measure of welcome to accord
to the widely different gifts of Rossetti and
Burne-Jones.</p>

<p>But although his talk was, for the most part,
serious in tone, he could show himself on
occasion to be possessed of the wildest high
spirits, and it was then he most clearly revealed
the qualities that were distinctively his in virtue
of his partly foreign extraction.</p>

<p>Indeed among the men who practised this
branch of art, I have known only two who
in personal intercourse gave any complete indication
of the humorous powers they possessed.
Perhaps neither Phil May nor Fred Barnard have
yet received their full meed of praise, and yet
in them, rather than in their better known contemporaries,
the tradition of the earlier humorists
survives. In one sense they may be said to have
shared between them the mantle of John Leech,
and they possessed this quality in common, that
their perception of the sources of laughter in life
was as clearly betrayed in personal association
as in the work that came from their hand. Phil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
May&#8217;s face was in itself a highly-coloured print
that made an instant appeal to any one endowed
even with a most rudimentary sense of humour,
and his talk, though it affected no brilliancy, very
clearly revealed the fact that the little pageant of
life which came within the range of his vision
struck itself at once into humorous outline. He
hardly saw life, indeed, in any other frame, and
the few finely selected lines with which he
registered the images that presented themselves
to his imagination seemed by instinctive preference
to exclude and to dismiss those graver
realities that were not his especial concern. And
yet so keen and so sure was his touch of life that
now and again his hand would outrun his purpose,
and leave, even upon the slightest drawing, a
suggestion of almost tragic import underlying its
laughing message. Fred Barnard was a humorist
through and through&mdash;at work or at play his
eye lighted unerringly on whatever might enrich
his humorous experience, and he was quick to
detect, though never with any lack of urbanity,
the little foibles of those with whom he was
brought into contact.</p>

<p>But I suppose it is to the stage that one&#8217;s
thoughts must naturally turn for the most telling
exposition of this particular quality. Nearly all
the comedians I have known have seemed to
accept it as a part of the duty which their profession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
imposes on them, that they should be as
amusing in the world as in the theatre. It
cannot be said, according to my own experience,
that they have always been successful, and I may
even go so far as to say that the laboured efforts
of the wilfully comic man mark off in remembrance
some of the dullest hours I have
passed. The penalty of the perpetual jester very
often, as one would think, a grievous burden to
himself, falls sometimes with even heavier incidence
upon those he has doomed to be amused.</p>

<p>I know it is a prevalent belief among
Americans that we English are wholly devoid of
that sense of humour in which many of their
own countrymen undoubtedly excel; and it may
perhaps, therefore, shock them to learn that, to a
taste differently educated, the unremitting efforts
of some of their professional jesters are apt on
occasion to appear a little overstrained. But in
some natures the appetite for the ceaseless flow
of comic anecdote is swiftly satisfied, and the
man who will insist upon unpacking his wallet
of well-worn stories for the intended delight of
his fellows may, if he is not watchful of the
effect he is producing, induce in the mind of
his audience a mood of settled sadness, that not
even the genius of a Dickens could lift or lighten.</p>

<p>This haunting fear lest conversation should at
any point take a serious note&mdash;which I cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
help thinking characteristic of many Americans&mdash;is
often to be found in our own country in
the person of the comedian by profession. It
existed perhaps in a lesser degree in J. L. Toole
than any other representative of his calling whom
I have intimately known. What rendered Toole
delightful in companionship was rarely anything
memorable that he said, for he made no effort
to pose as a wit, and his reminiscent humour,
which he could always summon at need, was for
the most part introduced in illustration of some
point of character humorously perceived and
presented. There are critics who have questioned
his appeal as a comedian in the theatre, but no
one brought into personal contact with him could
be left in any doubt as to the swiftness and
sureness of his vision in detecting and enjoying
the little foibles of those around him. In any
company, whatever its composition, his mind
got quickly to work upon each individuality in
the group; and, although he might not join
largely in the conversation, he loved to impart
to the companion by his side his keen sense
of enjoyment of the conflict and interplay of
character as it presented itself at the table.</p>

<p>Toole was a constant guest at those pleasant
little suppers in the Beefsteak Room of the
Lyceum Theatre over which Irving so gracefully
presided; and if one had the good fortune to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
his neighbour it was always delightful to watch
the expression of his swiftly-glancing, laughing
eyes and mobile mouth, as they mirrored, in
hardly-restrained amusement, his inward enjoyment
of the changing humours of the scene.
Nothing characteristic escaped him, however
widely divergent the personalities that came
within the range of his vision; but his quickness
of perception, ever ready to register and record
the little foibles of each member of the company,
bred in him no feeling of resentment, but seemed
rather to add to the rich store of enjoyment which,
in his happier moods, life always afforded him.
I say in his happier moods, because even in the
earlier days of our friendship, when his vitality
was unimpaired, his exuberant high spirits were
subject to sudden clouds of deep depression that
seemed for the time to banish all laughter from
his life.</p>

<p>Like Irving, he was an inveterately late sitter,
and the many occasions that found them together&mdash;either
at the theatre or at the Garrick Club&mdash;rarely
witnessed their parting till the morning
hours were far spent. In Toole&#8217;s case, I know,
this reluctance to break in upon the long duration
of these social hours sprang in part out of
a haunting terror of the sadder thoughts that
might overtake him when he was driven back
upon himself. He would often confess to me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
as we drove home, his constant dread of these
night fears, that were chiefly dominated at that
time by the recurring image of his only son,
whose early death remained with him to the
end as an ineffaceable source of sorrow. And
yet, while we talked of these sadder things, it
was sometimes irresistibly comic to notice, as
we drew towards his house, how this deeper
grief would then be exchanged for a terror of a
nearer kind, for he was always at these moments
very conscious that his persistently late habits&mdash;so
often repented of, but never reformed&mdash;would
surely draw down upon him severe domestic
rebuke. And even when the cab had reached
his door, he would hold me prisoner in whispered
converse in order to postpone, as long as he
could, the dread moment when he would have
to face the salutary lecture that was in store
for him.</p>

<p>But for the most part he was the gayest
and most light-hearted of companions, forcing
out of the most unhopeful material a rich yield
of fun and frolic. At home or abroad he was
never at a loss for the means of filling an empty
day. Sometimes, in his ceaseless tendency towards
practical joking, he would place himself
in positions that other men might have found embarrassing
and even dangerous. But there was
something so infectious in his humour, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
his good humour, that even on the Continent,
where he could speak no language but his own,
he was always able to extricate himself with
success from difficulties that would have left
many graver men without resource.</p>

<p>He dearly loved the excitement of the gaming
table, whether at Monte Carlo or elsewhere; and
I remember, during a holiday that we passed together
at Aix-les-Bains, that he did his best to
imperil the good effects of his cure by his constant
attendance at the Cercle and the Villa des Fleurs.
It was difficult to drag him from the table, however
late the hour, for his pathetic reply to every
remonstrance took the form of a solemn promise
that he would absolutely go to bed as soon as the
little pile before him was exhausted; a reply, the
humour of which he was himself only half-conscious,
for it pointed to the inevitable loss
that was the final result of all his gambling
transactions. After a night wherein he had
been more than usually successful in exhausting
the ready cash he carried about him, we made
our way in the morning to the little bank in the
main street of Aix-les-Bains, in order that he
might make a fresh draft upon his letter of
credit.</p>

<p>But he did not at once reveal to the clerk
in charge his serious intent. Tapping lightly at
the closed window of the <i>guichet</i>, he inquired,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
in broken English, which he appeared strangely
to believe would be somehow comprehensible to
his foreign interlocutor, whether the bank would
be prepared to make him a small advance upon
a gold-headed cane which he carried in his hand.
The request, as might be supposed, was somewhat
briskly dismissed, and the little window was
abruptly closed in his face. Toole retired apparently
deeply dejected by the refusal of his
prayer; but in a few minutes he returned to
the attack, having in the meantime provided
himself with fresh material for a new financial
proposition. Hastening out into the little
market that lay near the bank, he hurriedly
purchased from one of the fish-stalls a small
pike that had been caught in the lake, and,
having added to this a bunch of carrots, he
returned to the bank, where he carefully arranged
these proffered securities on the counter, enforced
by the addition of his watch and chain, a three-penny
bit, and a penknife. When all was ready
he again tapped softly at the window, and, in
a voice that was broken by sobs, implored the
clerk, in view of his unfortunate position, to
accept these ill-assorted articles in pledge for the
small sum which was needed to save him from
starvation. The clerk, by this time grown
indignant, requested him to leave the establishment,
explaining to him in emphatic terms, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
in such English as he could command, that they
only made advances upon circular notes or letters
of credit. At the last-named word Toole&#8217;s
saddened face suddenly broke into smiles, and,
producing his letter of credit, he handed it to
the astonished clerk, with the added explanation
that he would have offered that at first if he had
thought the bank cared about it, but that the
porter at the hotel had told him the bankers of
Aix liked fish better.</p>

<p>This is only a sample of the kind of adventure
that Toole loved to create for himself and which
he carried through with the keenest zest and
enjoyment. His invention in such matters never
flagged, and I have often been his companion
through the whole of an idle day, during
which he would keep us both fully employed
in the prosecution of these boyish frolics, that
may seem foolish enough in narration, but
were irresistible in their appeal, owing to the
unalloyed pleasure they brought him in their
progress. I have known many men who deem
themselves adepts at this kind of sport, but none
who were so convincing in their methods&mdash;none,
certainly, who took such an honest pleasure in
their work, or who used such infinite pains in
carrying the projected little plot to a successful
issue.</p>

<p>Once at Ramsgate he contrived to relieve the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
tedium of a Sunday afternoon by calling at nearly
every house in a long and respectable terrace,
charged with a mission that was foredoomed to
failure. As each door was opened Toole stood
on the step, his face distorted by signs of emotion,
that for the moment deprived him of all powers
of speech, and when at last, in response to the
angry inquiry of a maid-servant, he contrived to
regain a measure of self-control, it was only to
beg, in tearful accents, for the loan of &#8220;a small
piece of groundsel for a sick bird.&#8221; As door
after door was slammed in his face, his high
spirits correspondingly increased, his only fear
being, as he afterwards explained to me, lest some
one of the peaceful inhabitants whose Sabbath
repose he had so ruthlessly disturbed should, by
an evil chance, have possessed the remedy he so
persistently sought.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SITTING AT A PLAY</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> child&#8217;s love of the drama begins long before
there is any thought of a playhouse. To escape
from life in order to rediscover it in mimic
form, would seem to rank among the earliest
of human impulses. We are all born actors,
though some of us&mdash;and this is true even of
those who adopt the stage as a profession&mdash;would
seem occasionally to part with this primitive
instinct in later life. But an average child has
no sooner entered this world than he finds himself
pursued by the longing to create another:
he has scarcely had time to recognise his own
identity before he seeks to hide it beneath the
mask of an alien personality. How far the
youthful histrion believes himself to be a lion
when he crawls across the drawing-room carpet
on all fours, and roars from behind the sofa, is
perhaps open to argument. My own belief is
that he is already so much of an artist as to be
in no way deceived, but of his desire to impose
upon the credulity of others there can, I think,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
be no question. But the limits of histrionic
enjoyment are even here sometimes overstepped,
as, for example, when a maturer rival in the
art, boasting a louder roar, approaches too closely
to the confines of absolute illusion. The enjoyment
of the art as an art is then rudely disturbed,
and, shaken with sudden terror, the infant
Roscius is once more driven back upon that
actual world from which it had been his pride
and desire to escape.</p>

<p>This may be cited as an early instance of
the intemperate employment of the resources of
realism, which in later life, when sitting at a
play, we have so often just reason to deplore.
Again, the sudden assumption by a too eager
elder of a woolly hearth-rug may ruin at a stroke
the child&#8217;s purely imaginative vision that he is
in the society of a bear. Natural terror expels
in an instant that higher emotion which the
drama is designed to create. The child recognises
that the irrefutable laws of the art have
been rudely broken, to his own discomfort; and
it is always interesting to note on such occasions
with what quick and easy resource he will
suddenly change the whole subject and scope of
the mimic performance, imperiously demanding
that the bear shall be exchanged for a horse, or
some other domestic animal, whose milder
tendencies may be the more readily endured,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
even when the actor is forgetful of the proper
restraints of his art.</p>

<p>It is what survives of the child in us that
makes us all playgoers, although in the early
days of our playgoing the unsuspected resources
of illusion which the theatre can command are
often hard to endure. It is, I suppose, the experience
of most children&mdash;it certainly was mine&mdash;that
certain critical moments in drama, clearly
foreseen and eagerly anticipated, nevertheless prove
in realisation too thrilling and too intense for pure
delight; and I can recall occasions, such desired
moments being clearly in view, when I would
address a whispered request to one of my elders
that I might be permitted to watch the ensuing
scene from the safe vantage ground of the corridor
at the back of the dress circle. The small glass
window in the red baize door provided just that
added veil of distance which rendered the sufferings
of the persons on the stage artistically tolerable.
But the crisis once past&mdash;a crisis generally
signalised by the explosion of a pistol&mdash;I was eager
to return to my seat in order to appreciate with
unabated enjoyment the consequences of an act
of violence I had not had the courage to witness.</p>

<p>It is remarkable how little, in those very early
days of playgoing, we are at all concerned with
the personality of the actor. The story is all-absorbing,
and in the poignant interest in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
persons of the story, all memory of the performer
as a separate entity is submerged and effaced. I
had no thought at that time whether the actor
was good or bad. His performance appeared to
me to be inevitable and inevitably perfect. The
day when he takes separate existence, apart from
the character he is presenting, marks a revolution
in the life of the playgoer, a revolution that is
destined henceforward to complicate his emotions,
with never again any possible return to that earlier
and more confiding attitude when the illusion of
the scene is absolute and complete. It is difficult
even to recall the names of the actors who first
greatly stirred me. They hardly stain my
memory, for in my mind they had no separate
existence. But with this revolution is born a
new kind of enjoyment, that carries richer
recollections. The limitless world of illusion
shrinks to a narrower kingdom, but its triumphs
are more vivid and more enduring: the sense of
assumption and disguise is no longer so complete
or so convincing, but the message of revelation,
when it comes, brings with it a higher pleasure.</p>

<p>Nothing lives longer in remembrance, or
pictures itself more vividly, than the first impression
of the performance of a great actor.
Phelps was the earliest of my heroes of this
more sophisticated time, and the first of his
performances I can recall was that of Falstaff in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
<i>King Henry IV.</i> produced at Drury Lane.
Walter Montgomery was the Hotspur of the
occasion, and young Edmund Phelps figured as
Prince Hal. First impressions are hard to
supplant, and the visual presentment of Falstaff
even now always takes the form and shape
assigned to him by the elder Phelps on that
memorable evening. I saw him many times
afterwards&mdash;in <i>Othello</i> and <i>King John</i>, in Mephistopheles,
in Bayle Bernard&#8217;s version of Goethe&#8217;s
play, in Wolsey, in Sir Pertinax M&#8216;Sycophant,
and in John Bull; and, although the more
critical spirit of a later hour left him shorn
of some part of that perfection I thought was
his when I first saw him upon the stage,
he ranks even now in my recollection as a
great and gifted exponent of a great tradition.
In his personality there was little to allure. It
was rugged and bereft of many of the lighter
graces that are calculated to win an audience;
but his voice was incomparable, and the earnestness
of the artist beyond reproach. Nor could
variety of resource be denied him: he seemed
equally equipped for his task as King John,
Wolsey, or Falstaff, or as Bottom in the <i>Midsummer
Night&#8217;s Dream</i>. He fought his way to a
front rank in the profession at a time when older
playgoers were full of memories of men who
were perhaps his superiors&mdash;of Kemble, Kean,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
and, more recently, of Macready. But whatever
he owed to any of them&mdash;and I do not suppose
he was ever tempted to deny his debt&mdash;it is
impossible not to concede to him a rare measure
of individual power that must always leave him
his due rank among the English interpreters of
Shakespeare.</p>

<p>It must have been my first vision of Charles
Fechter which enabled me to realise as by a flash
how much Phelps suffered by lack of personal
charm and grace. In those days I had not seen
Fechter in Shakespeare. I knew him only as
the victorious lover and the conquering hero of
romantic drama. But, however conventional the
material upon which his talent was employed,
the glamour of his personality exercised an
overpowering fascination.</p>

<p>To the youth of both sexes Fechter&#8217;s foreign
accent constituted a charm in itself. The
rising cadence of his voice struck heroically
on the ear, and the swifter and freer gesture
which came of his Gallic origin added something
of extra fascination to the unquestionably great
gifts with which he was endowed. In those
days of the old Lyceum, when he was acting
in melodramas like <i>The Duke&#8217;s Motto</i> and
<i>Bel Demonio</i>, Miss Kate Terry was constantly
his partner and the two together seemed to
embody for the time the whole spirit of romance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
But the moment of Fechter&#8217;s acting which is
stamped most firmly in my recollection was in
the last act of <i>Ruy Blas</i>. It was not till long
afterwards when growing stoutness had robbed
him of that grace of form which belonged to
his earlier days, that I saw him in the part of
<i>Hamlet</i>, and it is perhaps hardly fair to test his
fitness as a Shakespearean actor by such later
impressions. To me, however, that foreign
cadence, which linked itself so well with the impersonation
of romantic heroism, left a jarring note
when it was yoked with the statelier measure
of English verse; and it was not till long afterwards,
when I saw Irving&#8217;s <i>Hamlet</i>, that I
realised for the first time how much of the
subtlety of the character and beauty of the play
could be realised within the walls of a theatre.</p>

<p>The playgoer&#8217;s memories refuse to obey any
strict chronological order. They are rather
governed by vividness of impression, which
summons with equal distinctness things seen
long ago and triumphs of a more recent date.
My first vision of Sarah Bernhardt retains
always a foremost place in my playgoing experience.
It was in Paris in the spring of
1876, and the play was <i>L&#8217;&Eacute;trang&egrave;re</i>. She
was surrounded by a company of rare distinction&mdash;Coquelin,
Croisette, and Mounet-Sully
amongst them. But I remember, as she came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
upon the stage, that a creature almost of another
race seemed suddenly to have invaded, and, at a
single stroke, to be dominating, the scene. Her
personality appeared at once to announce a new
dialect in the language of Art. Her mode of
speech and her method of acting left almost
unregarded and unremembered the particular
language in which the play was written. In
virtue of her genius she became at once an
international possession, leaving, by comparison,
the artists around her almost provincial in style
and method. I had previously seen Ristori, and
had marvelled at the wonders of her art in
Lucrezia Borgia and in Mary Stuart, an art
that was struck in a larger mould than Sarah
Bernhardt could claim; and I afterwards had
to acknowledge the superb force and matchless
physical resource which Salvini brought to the
theatre. But in neither case does the first impression
stand out so vividly in recollection as that
first impression of Sarah Bernhardt in Dumas&#8217; play.
And yet I remember Sir Frederick Leighton,
whose recollections of the theatre went back to
an earlier day, telling me that the effect produced
by Rachel left Sarah Bernhardt&#8217;s art by comparison
almost in the region of the commonplace.</p>

<p>I have mentioned the name of Coquelin,
whose talent in the region of comedy was consummate,
and even in this very performance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
of <i>L&#8217;&Eacute;trang&egrave;re</i> his impersonation of the Duc
de Septmonts leaves an ineffaceable recollection.
But I had already seen him in Moli&egrave;re, and it
was the endless resource with which he furnished
the creations of the master dramatist of France
that gives him, I think, his unapproachable place
in the modern theatre. His own rich enjoyment
of every discovered detail of the carefully
constructed portrait carried with it the magic of
infection, and, as the work grew under his hand,
the spectator was left with a pitiful consciousness
of his own dulness in having gathered from the
written page so small a part of the author&#8217;s
manifest intention. In so far as the actor&#8217;s art
seeks for the triumphs of assumption and disguise,
Coquelin was, indeed, beyond the reach of rivalry,
and it was perhaps pardonable, in view of his
own splendid achievement, that he should have
been disposed to question the claims of those
whose mastery in this particular direction was
not so complete as his own. Coquelin to the
last was intolerant of all acting which allowed
the personality of the performer to override the
identity of the particular character to be presented.
He could be admiring, and even enthusiastic,
over the art of Irving, but always with an
implied reservation&mdash;the English actor never,
to his thinking, sufficiently effaced himself in
his part; the performance, however brilliant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
in intellectual force, was marred, in Coquelin&#8217;s
judgment, by an imperfect surrender of personality,
and by a corresponding incompleteness of
assumption. And that was an unforgivable sin
in the eyes of the French artist.</p>

<p>It was agreeable to discuss these matters with
Coquelin, for he was a brilliant talker, quick in
insight, and ever ready with the terse and fit
phrase to illustrate his meaning. And it was
peculiarly interesting to me, because the argument
touched upon problems in the actor&#8217;s art
that I have always thought to be profoundly
significant. How far may the personality of the
performer intrude itself in the presentation of
the chosen character, and to what extent are
assumption and disguise part of the indispensable
equipment of the artist? These are questions
which every generation is apt to raise in regard
to its popular favourites upon the stage. And
the answer is not easy to find. To very many
it will seem indisputable that versatility carries
with it the hall-mark of perfection, and that no
actor can claim absolute victory in any individual
achievement unless we are allowed completely to
forget the person in the impersonation. Such
critics are the avowed champions of the art of
disguise, and yet, to me at least, they leave out
of account the most profound and most memorable
impressions which the theatre is able to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
yield. The scenes which have most deeply
moved me, the performers whose art has stirred
me to the strongest emotion, are hardly associated
in memory with any particular triumph of
characterisation. It is, in short, not disguise,
but revelation, which evokes and demands the
highest histrionic gifts. The ingenuity and resource
that can distinguish and exhibit the markings
of varying personality must, of course,
always count for much, but the imaginative
power which can recreate upon the scene the
simpler and deeper emotions that are common to
us all must surely count for more; and in the
exercise of this higher power the lighter accessories
employed to achieve completeness of
disguise must often be discarded and forgotten,
as the actor&#8217;s personality, impatient of all lesser
fetters that impede its utterance, becomes wholly
engaged in the task of communicating to his
audience the deeper and more enduring passions
of our common humanity.</p>

<p>Of course, some may dream that these opposite
qualities may be combined. I have never seen
them combined in any measure of completeness.
I remember thinking, when I first saw Sarah
Bernhardt in <i>Frou-Frou</i>, that her portraiture fell
far short of that of Descl&eacute;e, the original creator
of the r&ocirc;le. And so, in fact, it did. The countless
subtleties, by means of which the earlier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
performer had established the identity of the
frivolous heroine of one of the most masterly of
modern French plays, were all lacking in the
work of her successor; but in the great scene
in the third act, where the tensity of the situation
sounds a deeper note of drama, I felt disposed to
forget that any other <i>Frou-Frou</i> had ever existed.
Another illustration pointing in the same direction
may be found in the exquisite art of the Italian
actress, Eleanora Duse. When I saw her in the
<i>Dame aux cam&eacute;lias</i> it was impossible to believe
even for a moment that this perfect embodiment
of all that is beautiful in feminine nature owned
even the remotest relationship to the courtesan
whom Dumas had set himself to present upon
the stage. The unconquerable purity of her
artistic personality left her helpless in the presence
of her chosen task. As mere assumption the
performance counted for next to nothing, and yet
in its exquisite power to reveal the ever-deepening
emotions of a suffering human soul it was incomparable
and superb. It chanced that only three
nights afterwards I saw Sarah Bernhardt in this
same play, and the contrast was striking and
instructive. It might have been another story;
it certainly was another and a widely different
character. Possibly neither artist rendered
faithfully the author&#8217;s intention, and yet both
had produced an impression of intense enjoyment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
such as the theatre is rarely able to
confer.</p>

<p>On both of these evenings I had the good
fortune to sit beside Miss Ellen Terry, whose
presence in the theatre I think contributed in
no small degree to the almost inspired performances
of her comrades upon the stage. I
am not indiscreet enough to reveal her comparative
judgment of their competing claims, but I
remember considering at the time how far her own
presentation of Marguerite Gauthier, if she had
ever undertaken the part, would have compared
with the conception of either. Here, again, is an
instance of an artist who has never sought, or
who has sought in vain, to hide her own identity;
and yet of those who have felt the magic of her
influence in the ideal figure of Ophelia, in the
exquisite raillery of Beatrice, or in the tender
sentiment of Olivia, who is there who would
deny her right to the foremost place in her
profession? With her most surely the final
effect and impression rest upon powers of revelation&mdash;upon
the ability to realise and to interpret
the simplest and the subtlest phases of emotion,
far more than upon those artifices of deception
that make for the more obvious triumphs of
disguise.</p>

<p>It may, of course, be conceded that in his
critical and discriminating judgment of Irving&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
acting Coquelin had before him an extreme
example of marked personal idiosyncrasy. The
English actor, and no one was better aware of
the fact than himself, was partly hampered in
the exercise of his art by physical peculiarities
that for many years proved a serious hindrance
in his career. But, even if he could have shaken
himself wholly free of them, he could never
have effaced the personality that lay behind
them. It is, indeed, impossible to conceive a
more striking contrast than was presented by the
two men as I used often to see them in those
intimate little supper-parties at the Lyceum.
Coquelin, despite his alert and agile intelligence,
remained in outward appearance almost defiantly
bourgeois, and this indelible stamp of his origin,
which art had done nothing to refashion or refine,
never showed so clearly as when he stood beside
the English actor, who, with no better social
title than his own, nevertheless carried about
him a nameless sense of race and breeding. I
remember one night when they stood up side
by side towards the close of a long evening,
Coquelin&#8217;s silhouette bulging in somewhat rotund
line as it traversed his ample waistcoat, the
comedian was enlarging in earnest and eager
tones as to his plans for the future. &#8220;I have
the intention,&#8221; he said to Irving, in his halting
English, &#8220;I have the intention next year to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
assume the r&ocirc;le of <i>Richard III.</i>&#8221; Irving seemed
thoughtful for a moment, and then his long,
slender fingers lightly tapping that protuberant
outline, he murmured, as though half to himself,
&#8220;Would you? I wonder!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SIR ARTHUR SULLIVAN</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Arthur Sullivan&#8217;s</span> final claims as a composer
can only be settled by time. It is not allowed,
even to the expert, to hasten the judgment of
posterity, for, as we know from experience, that
judgment does not always accord with the
verdict even of the most learned of the living.
But there is one fact which in Sullivan&#8217;s case
time cannot dispute, and that is the extraordinary
influence which he exercised over his generation.
There is possibly no Englishman in any realm
of art who, during the same period, won the
admiration of so many of his fellows: none
assuredly whose genius entered with so sweet a
welcome into so many English homes.</p>

<p>The art of the musician where it is destined
to win any form of popular response has indeed
this peculiar prerogative. The processes of its
production are hedged around with special
technicalities that can be comprehended only
by the few, but its completed message owns a
universal language that no other art can command.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
And those of us who know of music
no more than the pleasure it confers ought not
on that account to withhold our tribute of praise
from a master who has charmed us all. It is
not only the super-subtle or the obscure which
merits respect, and we need not, therefore, be
too timorous in confessing our love of that
which we are permitted to understand, resting
assured that there will remain critics enough to
deliver the sterner judgment of the higher courts.
And amongst such critics there is a certain
section in music, as in literature, or in painting,
whose ears are so finely tuned to catch the first
whisper of the moderating voice of the time to
come, that they are apt to lose their nerve for
praise of their contemporaries: others again so
beset with the cant of categories that they must
needs deplore in the case of every gifted artist
who chances also to be popular that his gifts are
not engaged in other and loftier employment.
We need not, however, be too greatly concerned
with censure of this sort; for the accepted
formulas of criticism are after all but the reflex
of past achievement, and are liable to be recast
or enlarged in accordance with the needs and
resources of those who have the power to remodel
them. Genius, indeed, takes little account
of the accepted classifications of the schools, and
forms of art that were deemed capable of holding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
only so much as they have hitherto contained
are suddenly transformed at the touch of new
invention, which, in its turn, forges new fetters
doomed again to be shattered by the advent of
some later individuality.</p>

<p>But it is the personality of the artist rather
than the quality of his work that now chiefly
concerns us. Of the latter, indeed, the present
writer has no title to speak save in terms of
grateful admiration, and although it is true of
every man of genius that the finest attributes of
his nature lie surely enshrined in the fruit of his
life&#8217;s labour, yet those who enjoyed the privilege
of Arthur Sullivan&#8217;s friendship may be pardoned
for thinking that the art with which he charmed
the world still left unrevealed a deeper fascination
in the man himself. So much at least is
certain, that only those who knew him well
were able to realise the perfect accord that
existed between the artist and his work. This,
as we know, is not always easy to discover.
Life sometimes refuses to surrender any hint of
the subtler graces that stand confessed in the
artistic record given to the world for its enjoyment;
and, on the other hand, it will as often
happen that the product of hand or brain seems
sternly to exclude some more intimate charm
that friendship alone can claim to have discovered.
It was not so in Sullivan&#8217;s case. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
man and the artist were woven of one fabric
throughout, and those who have enjoyed the
varied phases of his music, from its graver to
its lighter strains, may be said to have possessed
a faithful index to the purely personal qualities
that won the affection of his friends. In the
unstudied converse of daily life he exhibited in
himself that same swift grace of alternating
mood that is so characteristic of his art. He
was never afraid of the sudden entry of humour
into a discussion of the most serious theme, or
of sounding a deeper and graver note, however
closely it may have followed upon the heels of
recent laughter. It was this that made him the
most delightful of companions. His instinct
was so sure, his sympathy so finely tuned, that
he never missed his footing: his sense of harmony
in friendship, as in art, so absolutely irreproachable,
that he never struck a jarring note.</p>

<p>A great simplicity and generosity of nature
lay, I think, at the root of the rare social charm
he possessed. In all my recollections of our
companionship I cannot recall a single ill-natured
word towards friend or acquaintance, or
any bitter criticism of a comrade in art. In
another man such restraint might have seemed
insipid: in his case it was instinctive and
obviously sincere. He was naturally endowed
with the genius of friendship, and what he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
to say in the way of serious criticism was
delivered with such generous understanding of
the claims of other arts with which he was
brought into association, that it could never give
offence. It was my good fortune more than
once to be closely allied with him in the
execution of a common task, and those who
have written for music will know how constant
are the opportunities for friction between the
author and the composer. The conflicting
claims of music and drama must needs breed
keen discussion, and sometimes even marked
divergence of view, but with Arthur Sullivan
the sense of what was essential in the requirements
he had to meet was so quick and so true
that it was rarely possible to withhold any concession
he might finally see fit to demand.</p>

<p>We met first in the seventies when we were
fellow-guests in a country-house in Scotland.
The house party was a large one, and Sir Arthur
Sullivan, laying aside all claim to the kind of
consideration to which his reputation entitled
him, became at once the life and soul of the
varied entertainments that were organised during
the evenings of our visit. If there were private
theatricals or tableaux vivants he would cheerfully
supply the incidental music required for
the occasion, and was so little preoccupied with
the dignity of his position as composer that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
would willingly accompany the songs of every
amateur, and when the need arose would seat
himself patiently at the piano to provide the
music for an improvised dance. We met often
in the years that followed, and our acquaintance
quickly ripened into a close and lasting friendship.
In the riverside houses, which he used
then to take during the summer months of the
year, he was the most delightful of hosts, and
when I was able to accompany him on some of
his trips abroad, I found in his companionship
a charm that never failed.</p>

<p>In 1894 he was invited by Sir Henry Irving
to compose the music for my play of King Arthur,
and he became so deeply interested in the subject
that he afterwards planned the execution of an
opera dealing with the fortunes of Launcelot
and Guinevere, for which I was to supply the
libretto. Owing to failing health, however, the
scheme was never carried to completion, and it
is perhaps open to question whether the sustained
effort needed for the interpretation of a serious
and tragic theme would have so nicely fitted the
natural bent of his genius as the lighter framework
provided for him by Sir William Gilbert.</p>

<p>Certainly the alliance of these two men proved
of rare value to their generation. It is impossible
to conceive of talents so differently moulded or
so sharply contrasted, a contrast that found an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
apt reflection in their strikingly divergent personalities.
At the first glance their partnership
would hardly seem to promise a fruitful result,
and yet it was perhaps out of their very unlikeness
that they were enabled to derive something
of constant inspiration from one another. Gilbert&#8217;s
humour, perhaps the most individual in his
generation, was cloaked beneath a somewhat
sullen exterior. The settled gravity of his
expression, sometimes almost menacing in the
sense of slumbering hostility which it conveyed,
gave hardly a hint of those sudden flashes of
wit which came like quick lightning from a
lowering sky, and was as far removed as possible
from the sunny radiance of Sullivan&#8217;s face,
wherein the look of resident geniality stood ready
on the smallest provocation to reflect every passing
mood of quickly responsive appreciation. Many
of the pungent epigrams of Gilbert are well
known, and if they were not in every case
invented on the spur of the moment, they
were uttered with such apparent reluctance to
disturb the settled gravity of his demeanour as
to produce in the listener the conviction that
he himself was the last person to suspect their
existence. Very often indeed they were obviously
born of the moment of their utterance. I remember
our both being present in the stalls of a
theatre listening to an actor who was wont to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
mask his occasional departure from strict sobriety
by the adoption of a confidential tone in delivery
that sank sometimes to the confines of a whisper,
when Gilbert, leaning over my shoulder, remarked,
&#8220;No one admires the art of Mr. K&mdash;&mdash;
more than I do, but I always feel I am taking a
liberty in overhearing what he says.&#8221; At another
time, when he had been invited to attend a concert
in aid of the Soldiers&#8217; Daughters&#8217; Home, he replied
with polite gravity that he feared he would
not be able to be present at the concert, but that
he would be delighted to see one of the soldiers&#8217;
daughters home after the entertainment. These
are only two samples drawn at random from an
inexhaustible store of such sayings as must survive
in the memory of all who knew him, and the
special flavour that is impressed upon them all
is equally to be noted in his work for the theatre,
more particularly in those lyrical portions of the
operas composed in association with Sullivan.
In the art of stating a purely prosaic proposition
in terms of verse he was indeed without rival.
His metrical skill only served to emphasise more
deeply the essential unfitness of the poetic form
for the message he had to convey; and this
unconcealed discordance between the essence of
the thought to be expressed and the vehicle
chosen for its expression, became irresistible in its
humorous appeal even before it had received its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
musical setting. And yet that setting, as supplied
by Sullivan, gave to the whole a unique value.
The sardonic spirit of the writer not only called
forth in Sullivan a corresponding humour in the
adaptation of serious musical form, but it enabled
him to super-add qualities of grace and beauty
which deserved to rank as an independent contribution
of his own. In this way the combined
result possessed a measure of poetic charm and
glamour which Gilbert&#8217;s verse in itself, despite
its rare technical qualities, could not pretend to
claim, although without the impulse supplied
by his more prosaic partner, it may be doubted
whether even the finer graces of Sullivan&#8217;s genius
would have found such apt and fortunate expression.
Certain it is that where the task imposed
upon him lacked the support of this satiric spirit,
he often laboured with a reward less entirely
satisfying, and, on the other hand, I think Gilbert
himself was impelled by the exigencies of their
comradeship to indulge a more fanciful invention
than was characteristic of his isolated efforts as
a writer of verse.</p>

<p>My final association with Sir Arthur Sullivan
arose out of my joint authorship with Sir Arthur
Pinero in the libretto of <i>The Beauty Stone</i>. I
think the composer was conscious that the
scheme of our work constituted a somewhat
violent departure from the lines upon which his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
success in the theatre had hitherto been achieved.
At an earlier time this fact in itself would not,
I believe, have proved unwelcome to him, for he
had confessed to me that he was sometimes weary
of the fetters which Gilbert&#8217;s particular satiric
vein imposed upon him, and his ambition rather
impelled him to make trial in a field where,
without encountering all the demands incident
to Grand Opera, he might be able to give freer
rein to the more serious side of his genius. But
the adventure, even had our share in the task
proved entirely satisfactory to the public, came
too late. Poor Sullivan was already a sick man.
Sufferings long and patiently endured had sapped
his power of sustained energy, and my recollection
of the days I passed with him in his villa at
Beaulieu, when he was engaged in setting the
lyrics I had written, are shadowed and saddened
by the impression then left upon me that he was
working under difficulties of a physical kind
almost too great to be borne. The old genial
spirit was still there, the quick humour in
appreciation and the ready sympathy in all that
concerned our common task, but the sunny
optimism of earlier days shone only fitfully
through the physical depression that lay heavily
upon him, and when a little later we came to
the strenuous times of rehearsal in the theatre,
one was forced to observe the strain he seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
constantly in need of putting upon himself in
order to get through the irksome labour of the
day. There were indeed brighter intervals when
he seemed in nothing changed from the man as
I first knew him, but on such happier moments
would quickly follow long seasons of depression,
showing itself sometimes in an irritability of
temper so foreign to his real nature as to raise
in the minds of his friends feelings of deep disquietude
and anxiety. But the Sullivan of those
moods of dejection is not the man whose portrait
lives in the memory of those who knew him.
It is easier to think of him in those earlier days
when the constant urbanity of his outlook upon
the world was lightened by a laughing humour
constantly inspired by sympathy and affection.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE JUNIOR OF THE CIRCUIT</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I first joined the Northern circuit in the
year 1872, it covered a wider area than is now
allotted to it. We used at that time to begin
operations at Appleby, journeying thence from
Durham to Newcastle, Carlisle, Lancaster, Manchester,
and Liverpool. The members of the
Local Bar in the two last-named cities were
already strong and powerful, but they had not
yet absorbed so large a share of the business of
the assizes as they now enjoy. It was Charles
Crompton&mdash;with whom I had read in chambers&mdash;who
secured for me the coveted position of
Junior of the circuit, and the first occasion on
which I set out to discharge the somewhat
anomalous duties of my office I shared rooms at
Durham with the present Mr. Justice Kennedy,
who, I think, had himself been a candidate for
the post.</p>

<p>I have referred to the duties of the Junior
of the circuit as being somewhat anomalous,
because although, as his title would imply, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
is always chosen from the newest of its recruits,
tradition dowers him with a figment of authority
which is altogether out of proportion to any
personal qualifications he may chance to possess.
He disputes the leadership of the circuit with
the leader himself, and is assumed to hold
specially in his keeping the interests of the Junior
Bar as opposed to whatever arrogant claims may
be put forward by the more fortunate wearers of
the silken gown. To this defiant attitude, where
the opportunity for defiance was in any sense
possible, I was constantly urged by the members
of the Junior Bar, whose cause I was supposed
to champion; and it was deemed a duty, which
no Junior of spirit could safely ignore, that on any
public occasion when he had to stand up as spokesman
of the circuit, he should depreciate, with all
the resources at his disposal, both the intellectual
prowess and the professional bearing of the eminent
Queen&#8217;s counsel who were assembled at assize.
The dignity thus assigned to him was, of course,
only half-humorously entertained by his comrades
of both ranks, but so much of reality still
attached to the office that the holder of it, if he
chose to take advantage of the situation, found
ample opportunity for the trial and exercise of
such gifts of oratory as he might be fortunate
enough to possess. Wherever and whenever the
members of the circuit were entertained, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
Junior had to brace himself to his allotted task;
and although at the time I had been assigned no
opportunity of airing my powers of speech in open
court, these festive gatherings, which occurred in
nearly every separate county we visited, left me
free for the crude practice of an art that had
always profoundly attracted me.</p>

<p>The leaders of the Northern circuit, whose
virtues I was called upon to assail, numbered at
that time some of the most distinguished representatives
at the Bar. Herschell, Russell, Holker,
and Sam Pope had all either attained or were
nearing the zenith of their fame; while among
the Junior Bar it may suffice to cite the names
of the late Lord Selby (then Mr. Gully),
Mr. Henn Collins (the late Master of the Rolls),
Lord Mersey, and Mr. Justice Kennedy. It was
a privilege to watch the work in court in which
the powers of some of these giants of the profession
were daily called into exercise. I used to
hear some of my contemporaries sigh over the
weary ordeal of having to sit and listen to cases
in which they were not concerned; a little later,
in the courts at Westminster, I sometimes shared
that feeling of fatigue; but my experience of
two years of circuit life yields few dull memories.
The proceedings on circuit are perhaps more
concentrated in their interest than can, in the
nature of things, be claimed for the more scattered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
and diversified arena of the metropolis; one is
brought more nearly into touch with the chief
actors in the drama, and the incidents of the
day are renewed and discussed at the Bar mess
in the evening. It is possible there to gauge
and to measure the social qualities of the men
whose public performances in court are still under
consideration, and to link the more human side
of this or that great advocate, as it was frankly
and freely exhibited in those hours when we sat
at wine after dinner, with the purely intellectual
gifts that had been set in action during the day.
No one, for instance, who knew Mr. Russell
(afterwards Lord Russell of Killowen) only
by his conduct of a case in court, where the
qualities of an imperious temper joined to an
unrelenting gravity of manner coloured and
dominated the impression which even his most
eloquent speeches produced, could have readily
divined that he possessed at the same time a vein
of genuine sentiment that, in his more sympathetic
moods, showed itself as being no less clearly an
integral part of his nature. And yet this softer
side of his character was often shown at the
circuit mess, and I have more than once seen
his eyes moistened with tears as he would sing,
without any great pretence of art, one or more
of Moore&#8217;s sentimental Irish melodies.</p>

<p>Nor could it have been readily guessed that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
beneath the look of slumbering power which
marked Holker&#8217;s personality, there lurked a
quickened sense of humour of which he could
make agile display when the needs of the social
occasion called it into being. The almost daily
contest between these two men, so differently
equipped, and yet often so equally matched,
formed one of the most interesting subjects of
study to the youngster whose idle days were
passed in court; for down the length of the
circuit, from Durham to Liverpool, there were
few causes of any magnitude or importance in
which they were not both engaged, and their
divergent personalities and varying methods remain
to me now as an unfading recollection. It
was sometimes difficult to realise that Holker
owned any real claims to eloquence until the
cumulative effect of his untiring insistence found
its reflex in the favourable verdict of the jury.
That, at any rate, was the first impression.</p>

<p>It was only afterwards that the student was
able to realise what a wealth of intellectual
resource and unsleeping vigilance lay masked
beneath the somewhat uncouth exterior in which
the immobile and unresponsive features gave
scarcely a hint of the quick insight into human
nature, and the swift grasp of what was essential
either in the strength or the weakness of his
cause. Grace of oratory he certainly could never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
boast, but his very disability in this respect
seemed sometimes to serve him as a source of
power. His humble and deprecating manner,
as though he were struggling with a task too
great for him, made an irresistible appeal to
the sympathies of a Northern jury, who would
seem silently bidden to come to the aid of this
giant in distress, and who were never, I think,
aware that in leaning towards what they deemed
the weaker side, they were, in fact, the victims
of the most consummate art which cloaked
itself in almost blundering simplicity of phrase.
Russell&#8217;s more brilliant gifts as an orator often beat
in vain against what seemed at first sight to be the
ill-adjusted and cumbrous methods of his adversary;
while at other times the superior grace
and vehemence of his style carried him safely to
victory. Even at that date it seemed to me clear
that he was destined to take his place as the most
distinguished advocate at the Bar, and those who
had the privilege of watching his career at that
time had not long to wait to witness the fulfilment
of their prophecy. I think of him always
as an advocate, for although his natural gift of
speech might have fitted him to win renown in
almost any arena, it may nevertheless be justly
said of him that it was the office of advocacy
alone which furnished the needed impulse for
the display of his highest gifts as an orator. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
is possibly for that reason that his career in
Parliament never quite justified his commanding
reputation at the Bar, and it is certainly true&mdash;as
I myself have witnessed more than once&mdash;that
in the discharge of those lighter duties that fall
to a speaker on festal occasions he moved with
little ease of style and with far inferior effect.</p>

<p>It was the concrete issue, carrying with it a
full sense of responsibility, that was needed to
set in motion the great forces of character and
intellect that were his by right. It was the
sense of the duel that pricked him forward to
the display of his powers at their best; and it
is, I think, this same sense of the duel that forms
the supreme element of interest to those who are
called upon to watch the conduct of a great trial
in which grave issues are at stake. To the
trained mind of the lawyer an intricate case, in
which only civil interests are involved, provides
perhaps the fullest opportunity for watching the
expert sword-play between two leaders who are fitly
armed for their task; but from the more human
and dramatic point of view it is the criminal
court in an assize town that more often attracts
the presence of the younger student. A murder
trial, where the man whose life is in the balance
stands before you in the dock during the long
hours of a protracted hearing, becomes, as the
case advances, absorbing, and even oppressive,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
in its interest. The very air of the crowded
court seems charged with the message of this
one human story; it is difficult, as the sordid
and pitiable facts are gradually revealed, to conceive
that there is any other drama than that
which is being enacted within those four walls.
And as the trial drags its course, with each new
link in the evidence seeming to forge a chain
that is gradually drawing closer around the
wretched being who stands before you in the
dock, the intensity of the situation becomes so
great and so strained that one is almost tempted
to believe that the whole world is awaiting that
one word from the lips of the jury which shall
set him free once more or send him to his doom.</p>

<p>I can recall many such trials during my brief
service on the Northern circuit, and sometimes
when the hearing outran the hours commonly
allotted for the sittings of the court, and when
judge and jury, by mutual consent, had agreed
that the end should be reached before the end
of the day, the inherent solemnity of the scene
would receive an added sense of awe and terror
as the fading daylight gradually deserted the
building, and the creeping shadows half-shrouded
the faces of the spectators eagerly and silently
intent upon every word that fell from the judge
in his summing-up&mdash;whose grave countenance,
only partly illumined by the candles that had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
set upon his desk, stood in dreadful contrast
with that of the prisoner who confronted him
with ashen face like that of a spectre in the
darkness. And once I remember, when the
fatal verdict had been given, and the judge had
passed to the dread task of pronouncing sentence&mdash;a
task never in my experience discharged
without the signs of visible emotion&mdash;the terror
of the scene was still further heightened as the
prisoner, shrieking for mercy, held fast to the
bar of the dock, and was only at last removed
by force to the cells below.</p>

<p>Such memories count among the sadder experiences
of circuit life, and were relieved by
much else in the ordinary work of the day that
leaves a happier recollection. I believe the
circuit mess has now greatly fallen from its
former estate; in my time it flourished exceedingly.
At each of the great towns we kept a
well-stocked cellar of our own, and it was the
business of the junior to see that the members
dining were kept well supplied with the wine
of their choice. The increase of the Local Bar
in many of the great centres has no doubt
considerably changed all this&mdash;with some loss, as
it must be, of the sense of good-fellowship which
then bound us together. But at that time those
nightly gatherings, at which nearly every member
of the circuit dined, kept alive a kind of schoolboy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
feeling that infected the graver leaders no
less than the Junior Bar. The dinner-hour
brought with it always something of a festal
spirit, and there were special occasions, such
as grand nights, that were wholly given over
to a frolic mood. We had our accredited Poet
Laureate, poor Hugh Shield, who has now joined
the majority, and whose duty it was to provide
the fitting doggerel to be recited at the mess.
Nor were these effusions too strictly judged, from
a purely literary point of view, if they were
sufficiently besprinkled with pungent personal
references to such members as were deemed to
afford fitting material for the exercise of the
poet&#8217;s humour. Another of those who was a
prodigal contributor to the humours of the
evening was M&#8216;Connell, who afterwards became
judge of the Middlesex Sessions. And even the
leader was not allowed to escape his contribution,
although it was sometimes hinted that his lighter
essays in prose and verse were supplied to him
by some one of his friends whose professional
services were not so fully employed.</p>

<p>Though the barrister&#8217;s calling did not long
hold me in its service, I have always retained
the keenest interest in the triumphs of its distinguished
representatives. Perhaps of no other
profession can it be so truly said that it is fitted to
claim the undivided allegiance of the strongest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
character and the keenest intellect; possibly, for
that reason it leaves the most indelible mark
upon its followers. A great lawyer, in whatever
arena he may be encountered, never quite divests
himself of the habit of the law; just as there are
some men who, by a natural academic inclination,
remain always and obviously members of their
University, no matter how far removed may be
the ultimate field of their activity. But if a
lawyer is always a lawyer, it is perhaps for that
very reason that he is often such excellent
company, and this, I think, applies especially to
members of the Common Law Bar, who do not
incur the same danger of becoming enmeshed in
the enclosing net of legal subtleties. With them
the study and knowledge of character becomes
often a greater element of strength, than a
profound knowledge of legal principles.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">BY THE SIDE OF A STREAM</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">If</span> a writer happens to be an angler, he will often
find himself when in holiday mood on the
banks of a trout stream. There is long warrant
for the association of these two callings. Since
the day of Izaak Walton, whom we still follow
with such delight in his rambles beside the Dove
or the Lea, the hand whose chief office it is to
hold the pen has again and again, in hours of
leisure, been found wielding the rod. We have
modern examples in Charles Kingsley, whose
&#8220;Chalk Stream Studies&#8221; may perhaps outlast
many of his more ambitious essays in literature;
and Mr. Froude has left among his miscellaneous
writings a delightful record of a day&#8217;s fishing on
a Hertfordshire stream. William Black, the
novelist, never tired of recounting to me his
various adventures in northern waters; and among
modern writers, Mr. Andrew Lang may also be
cited as an unwearying follower of the gentle
art. I think, indeed, the alliance I have noted
has in it something more than the accident of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
individual taste. There is no need for the long
leisure of a set holiday to enable the man of
letters to turn to his favourite recreation. The
more violent forms of sport, which exact the
devotion of a day, or of a series of days, require
the enforced cessation of all forms of literary toil;
but if the angler is fortunately located, work
and play are by no means inconsistent and&mdash;granted
that he is strong enough to resist during
the earlier hours of the day the alluring call of
the gentle south-west breeze with its alternating
changes of sun and cloud&mdash;the morning may still
hold him chained to his desk, sure of the reward
of his industry in the evening ramble by the
stream. And if his success as an angler be not
too complete&mdash;and how often it is not!&mdash;the
subject of his morning task will often renew
itself in the happy solitude that counts among
the many joys which angling can boast.</p>

<p>My own apprenticeship as a fisherman was
passed among the Cumberland hills. Earlier
experience had taken me no further than an
occasional day on the upper reaches of the
Thames, but even this cockney form of the
sport in its annual recurrence was looked forward
to with delight; and though the reward was
no more than a few gudgeon, with a rare and
occasional perch, such puny triumphs already
whetted my appetite for the day when I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
be admitted to the deeper mysteries of the fly-fisher&#8217;s
art. My first master in this higher
branch of the profession was no hero save to me.
He was a gentleman of unsettled occupation,
who dwelt in a cottage close beside Grasmere
Churchyard, where Wordsworth lies buried; and
by the more orderly characters of the village his
wayward habits of life, involving constantly recurring
lapses into inebriety, were regarded with
stern reprobation. But for me, at the time, any
doubt of the moral integrity of his character was
silenced by the indisputable fact that he was an
unrivalled professor of his art. I accepted him
without misgiving as my comrade and my master,
and this at least may be urged in mitigation of
the harsher judgment of the village, that the
night&#8217;s debauch, of which I was myself too often
the reluctant witness, never hindered him from
appearing under our cottage window as soon after
dawn as I was prepared to set out on our daily
expedition. His stock-in-trade as a fisherman
was of the homeliest and scantiest description.
His rod, consisting of two parts rudely spliced
together, had been fashioned by himself; and by
the side of the beck or the mountain tarn, with
fingers that alcohol still left incomparably steady
for their task, he would forge, with such rough
process of imitation as he could command, the
fly that he thought best suited for the conditions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
of the water or the day. In his company my
brother and I rambled far afield. There was no
upland stream or lonely pool within a circuit
of five miles where our untried skill was not
assiduously exercised. At that time the lakes
and rivers of Cumberland were not so unceasingly
flogged by the summer visitor, and there
were sequestered haunts well known to him that
were scarcely visited by the tourist at all.</p>

<p>One specially favoured spot was a tiny lake
called Harrop Tarn, surrounded by a quaking
bog, that lay in the hills above Thirlmere. My
revered master, though a genuine sportsman, was
not wholly irreproachable in regard to some delicate
questions that lay on the border-land of poaching,
and it was at Harrop, where the bank was
in most places unapproachable, that he initiated
us in the subtle mysteries of cross-lining. Be
it counted to his honour, however, that these
occasional departures from the stricter etiquette
of his calling were never undertaken without
enjoining on us the most solemn pledge of secrecy,
a fact that at the time gave to the delights of
almost certain success the added excitement of
some unknown personal risk and danger.</p>

<p>But the Lake district, it must be confessed,
was even then no paradise for the trout-fisher.
It satisfied well enough the moderate ambition
of a boy, who was still a bungler in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
art, and it served, at any rate, as fitting ground
for that patient apprenticeship which is necessary
to all who desire to become proficient in the
science and practice of casting a fly. Scotland,
a few years later, offered a wider field, with the
occasional chance of larger triumphs; and it
was there that I first became conscious of my
ability to meet my desired prey upon more equal
terms. The upper reaches of the Tay, as it
runs between Crianlarich and Killin, became
for many years my favourite hunting-ground.
The little inn at Luib was our resting-place, and
Loch Dochart, which lay five miles up the
stream, our favourite resort when wind and
weather served. I can recall no sense of fatigue
from the ten miles of mountain road that we
had to trudge by the time our day&#8217;s work was
done, though we were often drenched to the skin
before we reached the inn at night. Nor did
the inn itself, at that time, offer absolute protection
against the weather, and sometimes when
the storm beat heavily upon the uncertain roof
we had to make our way upstairs to our rooms
under the shelter of an umbrella.</p>

<p>Some years later I found my way to the Western
Highlands as the invited guest of a dear friend
who was almost as keen a fisherman as myself.
I had often heard of the <i>Salmo ferox</i>, whose
identity as a separate species is, I believe, still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
in dispute, but it was not until one memorable
day upon Loch Awe that I encountered the
monster in person. A fair morning had changed
suddenly to a wild storm of wind and rain, and
the surface of the lake was lashed into the
semblance of a mimic sea. Fly-fishing was out
of the question, and our gillie in despair suggested
that we might put out the trolling rod with a
large phantom minnow for bait, while we tried
to make our way against the wind back to the
landing-place. I do not think there was any
expectation even on his part that the endeavour
would yield any result, and I, who held the rod
in hands that were nearly frozen by the beating
rain, was entirely unprepared for the violent and
sudden tug that nearly wrenched it from my
grasp. But when that tug came, no one thought
any more about the storm, and for nearly half
an hour of throbbing excitement we were engaged
in a fierce struggle that seemed at any
moment likely to end in our ignominious defeat.
Again and again the great trout rose to the
surface and sprang high into the air, and then,
with sudden change of tactics, it would dive, as
it would seem, to the floor of the lake, and lie
in sullen resistance to such pressure as we dared
put upon the line. But the victory long delayed
was ours at last, not, however, I will admit,
without some element of disappointment in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
appearance and quality of our captive. A long,
lank fish, that scaled something between 8 lb.
and 9 lb., but which, if it had been in condition,
ought to have mounted to as much as half its
weight again: an ugly fish, with the mouth
and jaws of a pike, it still left us in wonder
where it had found the force to offer so stubborn
a resistance.</p>

<p>An occasional monster during a day which
seems to offer the prospect of only smaller fry is
one of the pleasurable excitements of loch-fishing
in Scotland. Only a few years ago I set out
in pleasant company from a cottage beside the
shores of Mull, to make a picnic near one of
the little lochs that lay about five miles up the
hill. Two or three of us had taken our
rods, but with no thought of a larger capture
than the small brown trout and Fontinalis with
which we knew these hill lochs were well
stocked. The day was busily spent, and most
of the party had already started homeward on
the downward path, when the gillie who was
with us said that he knew of another little loch
about a mile over the hill, where rumour had
it that there were certain larger trout which had
never been induced to rise to the fly. My host
and I, with one other companion, determined
to make trial of this unconquered pool, and set
out across the heather just as the sun was beginning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
to dip behind the shelter of the hill. It
had been a scorching day, and was a lovely
evening. As we came in sight of the little loch
it seemed to us both that if these reluctant fish
were ever to be lured to the net, the present
was the most propitious occasion for the
adventure.</p>

<p>It chanced that my friend had in his case a
fine cast of drawn gut with a small floating fly,
which a month or two before he had used on
a southern stream; I myself had chosen an
Alder of a pattern I had found efficient two
or three years before on some of the little lochs
above Glenmuich. Our gillie knew nothing of
the mysteries of the dry fly, though he had
heard tell of its wonders, and it was indeed
mainly at his instigation that we were tempted
to present this lure on the present occasion.
We threw our lines almost simultaneously far
out into the tranquil surface of the pool, but
the luck was with my rival, for his fly had
scarcely reached the water when there came
a sudden flop and a splash, and it was evident
by the mighty rush, that took out nearly the
whole of the line from his reel, that the legend
related to us by the keeper had a solid foundation
in fact. It is astonishing what strength and
persistence these larger lake trout display. A
fish of equal weight in the Test or the Itchen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
would most assuredly have been brought to
bank within half an hour or less, but on this
occasion it was nearer three hours before our
capture was complete. A part of our difficulty
was due to the fact that the tackle was of the
finest, so that it was impossible to put any strain
upon the line; and even, at the last, when the
struggle was practically at an end, there came
the added difficulty that the long gloaming had
fallen into darkness, and the application of
the landing-net became a hazardous operation.
Twice the line nearly parted when the fish was
within less than a yard of the bank; but when
it was safely netted it proved to be a splendid
trout of something over 4&frac12; lb., in perfection of
colour and condition. It was under a moonless
sky and in pitch darkness that we picked our
way amid the rough boulders down to the valley
below, where we were met within a mile of
home by the rest of our party, who had already
set out with lanterns to come to our rescue.</p>

<p>There is not often occasion for the use of the
dry fly in the Highlands, though I remember
employing it with some success one evening at
Kinloch-Rannoch, where the waters of the river
run with tranquil flow from the lake. But it
is a delightful branch of the fly-fisher&#8217;s craft, of
unending fascination to those who have once
gained a mastery over its secrets. For some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
years I was in happy possession of a little cottage
on the upper reaches of the Lea, where the
narrow stream, in places no more than a few
yards across, gave no hint, save to the initiated,
of the heavy fish which found a home and haunt
under its banks. It was, indeed, only during the
annual rise of the May-fly that this little river
made anything like a full announcement of its
thriving population. During the weeks before
and after this recurrent season of debauch, there
was little chance of a heavy basket, and for that
reason it made a delightful home for any one
occupied in writing, to whom at those seasons
the banks of the stream offered no compelling
temptation. Two or three hours in the evening
after work was done sufficed to test the chances
of sport, and I was amply satisfied if I returned
to the cottage at nightfall with a brace or a brace
and a half of handsome trout. But with the
advent of the May-fly my desk, I confess, was
deserted. From my windows, as I tried to
write, I could hear and see the constant splashing
in the stream which proclaimed that the fish
were already on the feed. The cottage and the
stretch of river that belonged to it are, alas! no
longer mine, and I am told that there, as in so
many other southern streams, the rise of the fly
is no more what it was ten years ago. In those
days, on a favourable morning, the meadows that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
bordered the water were all alight with myriads
of these beautiful ephemorae, and the stream
itself, as far as the eye could trace its course,
literally alive with the boil and splash of the
feeding fish. For every fly that touched the
water there seemed to be an attendant and
expectant trout. Larger fish, that kept to their
deeper haunts at other seasons, now took up their
stations in mid-stream, and the veriest tiro in
these favouring circumstances could scarcely go
home with an empty basket. But there are days
of luck and days of disaster at all seasons: days
even during the May-fly time when the most
skilful fisherman has sometimes to confess a series
of mishaps, while a companion not a hundred
yards away is crowned with good fortune.
When the weed is heavy&mdash;and for my part I
have a liking for the presence of the weed, and
deprecate the close shearing of the stream which
is too often the modern habit&mdash;it is inevitable
that some of the heavier fish should make their
escape. The most fortunate morning that I can
recall was a basket of twelve fish, weighing in
all 28&frac12; lb.; and the largest trout that has ever
fallen to my rod there, though by no means the
largest known to the river, was within an ounce
of 4 lb.</p>

<p>In days of early spring or late summer, when
there is no rise of fly to tempt the angler, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
keeper and I used to find congenial occupation
in ridding the stream of some of the heavy jack
that were apt in those days to come from Luton
Hoo. It was he who first initiated me in the
art, of which he himself was a past master, of
securing these marauding cannibals by the aid of
a running wire. Like many a good keeper, he
had been in his boyhood something of a poacher,
and even in those later days, when his morality
was beyond reproach, be retained certain stealthy
and secret ways that dated from the lawless times
of his youth. At any likely bend of the stream,
where a deeper pool rendered probable the
presence of a jack, and when I might perhaps be
deploring the fact that we had left our wires at
the cottage, he would suddenly to my surprise
produce an ash sappling that lay hidden in the
long grass, not three yards away, with the running
noose already attached to its point. Nothing
could exceed the quickness of his vision in
detecting the neighbourhood of his prey, and
nothing could equal the incomparable steadiness
of his hand as he reached far out across the
stream and deftly passed the wire over the head
of the jack as it lay half asleep in the sun.
And then, before I was aware that the operation
was complete, with a sudden wrench that almost
cut the fish in twain he would lift a jack of 4
lb. or 5 lb. high into the air, and fling it over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
his head on to the bank. It was perhaps the
recollection of his earlier poaching days that
made him so zealous and watchful during the
spawning season, which offers to the poacher his
favourite opportunity. At these times he would
spend long hours of the night beside the stream,
never seeming to grudge any demand that was
made upon his rest, and it was while he was so
employed that he made capture of a large otter,
whose marauding expeditions he had long reason
to suspect. Otters, I think, are not common
on that part of the Lea; certainly this was the
only specimen brought to my knowledge during
my long tenancy of the cottage. But even a
single otter can work ruinous havoc among the
trout, as we had then reason to know, and it was
therefore with pardonable pride that, when I
came down to breakfast one morning, he laid his
dead victim out to view on the little lawn in
front of the door.</p>

<p>I sometimes think that those who haunt the
country, without conscious sense of its many
beauties, are apt to learn and love its beauties
best. How often the memory of a day&#8217;s shooting
is indissolubly linked with the pattern of
a fading autumn sky, when we have stood at
the edge of a stubble field wondering whether
the growing twilight will suffice for the last
drive. And if this is true of other forms of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
sport, it is everlastingly true of fishing. There
is hardly a remembered day on a Scotch loch,
or beside a southern stream, which has not
stamped upon it some unfading image of landscape
beauty. It was not for that we set forth
in the morning, for then the changing lights in
a dappled sky counted for no more than a
promise of good sport; during those earlier
hours there is no feeling but a feeling of impatience
to be at work; and the splash of a
rising trout, before the rod is joined and ready
and the line run through its rings, is heard with
a sense of half-resentment lest we should have
missed the favourable moment of the day.
But as the hours pass, the mind becomes more
tranquilly attuned to its surroundings. The
keenness of the pursuit is still there, but little
by little the still spirit of the scene invades our
thoughts, and as we tramp home at nightfall
the landscape that was unregarded when we
set forth upon our adventure now seems to wrap
itself like a cloak around us with a spell that it
is impossible to resist. A hundred such visions,
born of an angler&#8217;s wanderings, come back to
me across the space of many years. I can see
the reeds etched against a sunset sky, as they
spring out of a little loch in the hills above the
inn at Tummel. And then, with a changing
flash of memory, the broad waters of Rannoch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
are outspread, fringed by its purple hills. And
then, again, in a homelier frame, I can see the
willows that border the Lea, their yellow leaves
turned to gold under the level rays of the
evening sun; and I can hear the nightingale in
the first notes of its song as I cross the plank
bridge that leads me homeward to the cottage
by the stream.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
